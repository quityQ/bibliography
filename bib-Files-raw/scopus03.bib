	abstract = {Background: There is widespread evidence of the purported benefits of employee organizational commitment (EOC) and its impact on both individual and organizational performance. This study contributes to this literature by providing a unique insight into this relationship, focusing on the interrelationship between EOC with hospital performance and the role of the provision of adequate facilities in eliciting EOC. Purpose: The aimof this studywas to introduce and empirically examine a newtheoreticalmodel in which it is argued that the performance of hospitals with regard to the provision of adequate facilities (medical facilities, support facilities, and staff resources) influences the level of EOC,which in turn influences hospital performancewith regard to patient care and operational effectiveness. Methodology/Approach: To examine the interrelationships between the provision of adequate facilities, EOC, and hospital performance, the study utilizes a survey of hospital managers. Results: The findings support the theoretical model, with the provision of support facilities and staff resources positively indirectly associated with both patient care and operational effectiveness through their impact on EOC. Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of providing adequate facilities and EOC within hospitals and suggest that CEOs and general managers should try to enhance the provision of such resources in an attempt to elicit EOC within their hospitals. Practice Implications: The findings suggest thatmanagers should try to enhance their provision of adequate facilities in order to elicit EOC and enhance hospital performance. With regard to medical facilities, they should consider and incorporate the latest technology and up-to-date equipment. They should also provide adequate staff resources, including appropriate numbers of beds, nurses, and doctors, to prevent Bfatigue[ (West, 2001, p. 41) and provide adequate support facilities. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: There is a compelling need for developing constructs in management science rather than adapting the constructs that have been developed in other domains. Having emerged in the 1950s, quality of work-life (QWL) measures have proved to be ineffective due to the lack of conceptual clarity and theoretical support. The article analyses the QWL measures highlights their coherence and verifies them for being used in specific contexts. Design/methodology/approach: The study includes three stages to develop a QWL Measurement Scale. Fourteen questions were developed based on QWL concepts. They were validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) which split the dimensions into five factors. A survey was conducted on 375 medical residents. Finally, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergence and validity were tested along the five dimensions. Findings: Results extend the QWL concept and provide theoretical support for the same. Five dimensions were developed to measure QWL namely: pay and benefits, supervision, intra-group relations, working conditions and training. Practical implications: The study may offer an overview of evaluation strategies to researchers and organizations that aim to improve employee QWL while they enhance its effectiveness through reliable instruments. Originality/value: The scale developed in this study contributes to the body of QWL literature in the healthcare arena. It may be beneficial to carry out further research in this domain. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The ability of academic staff to meet the goals set by the HEIs is of utmost importance. They must possess strong competencies and excellent personality to improve their performance and achieve the desired target. Although the effect of organizational and individual factors has been verified in previous studies, it remains unclear what underlying mechanisms explain the relationship. This study examined the role of personality as a mediator in the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and job performance. This research used a quantitative method with a total sample of 260 academic staff in private HEIs, which were analyzed using the SEM Amos software. The findings showed that LMX and job performance (β= -0.26) and LMX and personality (β= 0.42) were significantly related, and academic staff personality was found to have the most substantial effect on job performance (β= 1.07). The result also indicated that personality partially mediates the relationship between LMX and job performance. The study's findings propose that the management of HEIs can improve the organizational factors through the proper implementation of LMX, which will nurture individual factors' effectiveness and improve academic staff job performance. © 2023, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the success story of a software company, Adobe, in redesigning the workplace environment from cubicles to a connected collaborative workplace, which helped the organization optimize workplace usage. The goals were to design an innovative work environment to optimize the usage of the office portfolio, improve workplace service quality and infrastructure facilities of the portfolio, increase employee productivity, reduce technology costs, engage employees in a better way to enhance employee satisfaction, align workplace design with the brand, mobilize technology and enable a globalized workforce to facilitate higher productivity. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory research design method was adopted using the purposive sampling technique to collect data through semi-structured interviews with a team of nine property professionals from the operations team responsible for workspace redesign at Adobe in India. Findings: The main observations of the corporate real estate (CRE) manager were on what value parameters drive workplace redesign and how different software companies were creating strategies to manage workplace design or redesign change for optimal use of the organization portfolio. To discuss the CRE strategies of global software leaders, IBM and SAP were pointed out in this case. Research limitations/implications: The number of interviews were limited. The related parameters for workplace transformation are not necessarily complete. However, the parameters are regarded to include the most important aspects of workplace redesign. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights into how benchmarking in the workplace transformation function of the CRE industry can be applied to address portfolio-related challenges, divergent employee needs and improve workspace usability following energy-efficient policies. Practitioners can use this study as a guide to develop more effective workspace designs. Social implications: This study may guide other firms on successful workspace design initiatives that may overcome many obstacles in the workplace transformation process to have their intended impact on workplace efficiency and employee satisfaction. The case can be used as an inspiration for developing specific user-focused innovative workspace design in practice. Originality/value: Adopting the theoretical background of the person–environment fit theory, this study adds to the understanding of the operational model of a digitally connected workspace designed as per real estate needs and strategies to manage the CRE portfolio of the company. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The practice and popularity of telework has expanded significantly in the past few years, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a critical factor contributing to business resilience, the new work model challenged companies to figure out innovative ways to address contemporary organizational and employee needs. To address this gap, this study approaches the telework concept from a broader perspective, integrating inputs, outputs and outcomes in an analytical framework. Drawing from data collected based on interviews and questionnaires addressed to professionals in the business service industry who experienced telework, frequency analysis, discourse analysis and chi-square test were used to synthesize the findings. Results show that resource availability and professional relationships represent the basic factors, while technology may be more than a facilitator. Moreover, knowledge exchange, work–life balance and professional isolation are critical factors emerging from the virtual environment that influence work goals achievement. This study contributes to research by proposing a Telework Systematic Model (TSM), which addresses the interaction of various organizational dynamics factors as a result of mixed working patterns. The discussions address the future of work by including the hybrid work model, platform innovation and new business opportunities to enhance organizational resilience for sustainable innovation and change through digital technology. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual development approach has been adopted, based on a content analysis of 59 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals, to identify drivers, barriers, practices and consequences of AI adoption in B2B marketing. Based on these analyses and findings, a conceptual model is developed. Findings: This paper identifies the following two key drivers of AI adoption: the shortcomings of current marketing activities and the external pressure imposed by informatization. Seven outcomes are identified, namely, efficiency improvements, accuracy improvements, better decision-making, customer relationship improvements, sales increases, cost reductions and risk reductions. Based on information processing theory and organizational learning theory (OLT), an integrated conceptual framework is developed to explain the relationship between each construct of AI adoption in B2B marketing. Originality/value: This study is the first conceptual paper that synthesizes drivers, barriers and outcomes of AI adoption in B2B marketing. The conceptual model derived from the combination of information processing theory and OLT provides a comprehensive framework for future work and opens avenues of research on this topic.

The complementarity framework perspective and the economic theory of incentives were the theoretical approaches applied in the development of hypotheses. Data from four waves of the European Working Conditions Survey were used in the empirical analyses. A positive association was found between computer use and the three pay for performance schemes considered, particularly team and firm pay for performance. The results also indicated that this relationship was partially explained by changes in job design due to computerisation, such as higher job complexity, on-the-job training and teamwork. © 2021 The Authors.

This research employed a quantitative methodology using a survey data amongst 178 adults in Malaysia. Hypotheses were tested through two levels of ordinary least squares regression models. The results showed that social influence is positively related with both frequencies of use and perceived usefulness. However, web security was associated only with the former whilst political trust was associated only with the latter. Lastly, we found a weak relationship between information literacy and the frequency of use. Overall, this paper tested on a comprehensive model of supply-demand factors on a broader perspective of e-government effectiveness amongst users. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

To answer this question Once Upon a Time in Facilities Management explores storied spaces and metaphorical archetypes in the study of business, management, and organization. At its core, the authors offer a diagnostic approach for the study of work organization that links management theory, storytelling, and the business imaginary. An important empirical focus is also included that explores a business service rarely studied in the management literature: Facilities Management (FM), a 'secondary service' of non-core and increasingly outsourced organizational functions. An in-depth appreciation of FM is provided that assesses the people, practices, and processes of the service in a study that also highlights the characteristic liminality of the sector's professional activities. Emphasis is placed on illuminating the storytelling nature of the service, using primarily the genre of fairytales to identify representational archetypes (including queen, shadow, sage, trickster, adventurer, and eternal child) within FM's storied space. In the process, three central characters (essentially modes of FM delivery) are identified - the professional consultant, the external service provider, and the in-house function - with these forming the structural basis of fairytales explaining the culture and symbolism of FM as a business service. The authors conclude by extrapolating findings from the study to inform a discussion of the contributions of folkloric analysis to organization theory explicitly and our understanding of business and management practice more widely. © Patricia McCarroll and John Hassard 2024.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the importance of leadership – distributed leadership (DL) – for the relationship between organizational learning (OL) and business sustainability (BS). Design/methodology/approach: Extensive literature research was carried out to investigate the relationship among leadership, OL and BS. Two theoretical frameworks of the relationship among DL, OL and BS were formulated and tested on the basis of the empirical studies conducted in 694 Polish and Danish companies. The moderated multiple regression and mediation analysis were used. Findings: In-depth, critical literature analysis has shown that the theoretical foundation of the relationship between leadership and BS is limited and not empirically verified. However, the empirical study has revealed a positive, statistically significant effect of DL on both OL and BS and the mediating role of OL on the relationship between DL and BS (a partial and complimentary mediation). Research limitations/implications: It would be valuable to simultaneously consider other leadership types (beyond DL) in terms of their impact on OL and BS. Additionally, due to the nature of BS challenges and the specificity of DL, other factors influencing BS should be included for a more profound understanding of the relationships under investigation. Finally, additional contextual factors need to be taken into account. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper is one of the first studies that present the relationship between OL and BS with reference to factors influencing BS, i.e. leadership. The value of the paper is the development of two alternative models of the relationship among DL, OL and BS and their verification through large-scale empirical cross-country research. Furthermore, the results obtained in the course of the research open up new research directions with respect to the development of the concept of sustainable leadership and deepen the knowledge of the relationship between leadership types and OL. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The interaction takes place in a context that is rapidly transforming. New forms of care provision are emerging through technology and digitalization. This may involve predictive care, but also clients who organize themselves via, for example, a platform in order to gain more influence on the care process. This is about the connection between technological innovation and social innovation. Technological innovation has various components: Home, Garden and Kitchen Technology, but also the application possibilities of artificial intelligence. Social innovation is reflected in, for example, healthcare cooperatives. Social innovation is expressed in various ways to achieve more autonomy. An important part is that clients have access to their own health information. In terms of policy, it is about interpreting demand-driven management: the organization of care on the basis of an equal position between client and care professional, whereby the client has the relevant health information available. Interacting with each other in a certain way creates a form of life however, it can also be interpreted differently. For both, it is about finding meaning in which the unequal roles lead to equal people. Important elements are: understanding of each other's position, reflection on the own position, provision of information that matches the client's wishes and approach of the care professional, information provision that meets the needs of informal caregivers, funding model that facilitates equivalence and space for professionals to handle variety (innovation of regulatory space). © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A firm's competitive advantage is permanently being contested. Thus, preserving this competitive advantage is critical. Consequently, firms can innovate to survive and thrive through two mechanisms: crowdsourcing and online social networks. However, the interrelationships between these mechanisms are poorly understood and need further testing. Online social networks and crowdsourcing involve individuals who are encouraged to share ideas, driving innovation through knowledge provision. This study aims to determine the importance of online social networks and crowdsourcing as elements that favor organizational learning processes to promote organizational development. This paper presents a set of hypotheses on the relationships between these variables. The findings suggest that online social networks, crowdsourcing, and organizational performance are correlated. Therefore, both of the research hypotheses are supported. Online social networks are shown to play an important role in companies by positively influencing the performance of organizations. Similarly, crowdsourcing is shown to benefit organizational performance. © 2021},

A learning orientation strengthens supply chain practices, potentially extending its impact beyond mere business transactions to enhance sustainability through knowledge transfer. Empirical results reveal the relationships among the constructs and serial mediation of supply chain relationship and supply chain agility. The empirical data were collected from organizations in the United Arab Emirates. The structural equation modeling approach is applied to validate the models in the study. Mediation analysis was performed to better understand the organizational and supply chain phenomenon. In addition, this study provides empirical support for serial mediation, with supply chain relationships and supply chain agility mediating the relationship between learning orientation and corporate sustainability. The study draws managers' attention to the importance of learning orientation as well as supply chain relationship and supply chain agility post-COVID-19. The findings may guide firms toward designing their sustainable supply chain strategies under organizational learning.

Based on them, we designed, developed, and implemented a first IDSA prototype for higher education institutions (HEI). We continuously evaluated the prototype within different workshops and analyzed the usage data to improve it further in three enhanced prototypes. Based on this iterative process, we derived guidelines for an IDSA design and development. Accordingly, the framework, project management, content, team selection, team development, team communication, marketing, and student habits are important to consider.

	abstract = {Drawing its origins from the Human Relations movement of the early 20th century and from public leadership orientations emphasising human aspects, human-centred public leadership approaches leadership from a system´s perspective. It explores societal institutions, organisations, and phenomena as an emergent system structure that manifests its existence through the multilateral and reciprocal interaction of its parts. Systems thinking and the need for systemic change suggest that one can only understand and improve a system by looking at how all the parts interact with each other and how they are integrated. The systemic nature of public leadership refers to dynamic learning mechanisms as they relate to the contents of leadership development tools which are derived mainly from the changing mode of the operating environment, from the leaders’ own experience, from their own personalities, from a learning-by-doing approach to leadership development, and from the ways in which leaders learn and unlearn. This book presents key concepts, approaches, origins, applications, and best practices to understand the evolution and nature of human-centred approach in public leadership. It introduces a new public leadership paradigm that is needed in a complex, internationally interconnected social, economic, cultural, and political environment. Based on scholarly public leadership research in addition to the authors’ professional experience as academics, managers, practitioners and consultants, this volume offers guidance for decision-makers, public, business, and non-governmental sector leaders, managers, and practitioners about how to create a context and contents for human-centred leadership in the age of complex society and turbulent operating environment. It will be of value to researchers, academics, and students in the in the fields of leadership and public management. © 2023 Petri Virtanen, Marika Tammeaid and Harri Jalonen. All rights reserved.},

This meta-analysis investigates the effects of four leadership styles on psychological empowerment. More specifically, we test whether empowering leadership evokes more psychological empowerment than transformational leadership, servant leadership, or transactional leadership. We found that empowering, transformational and servant leadership contribute almost equally to psychological empowerment. No relationship was found with transactional leadership. In an explorative manner, we tested the effects on the different dimensions of psychological empowerment. We found that the leadership styles had a weaker influence on the competence dimension of psychological empowerment. We also investigated the effects of several moderators on the relationships with psychological empowerment: country culture (power balanced freedom (PBF)), study design (cross-sectional vs. multi-wave studies) and publication status (published vs. unpublished). We found no moderating effects of culture, which indicates the universally empowering effects of the leadership styles. The relationships between leadership and empowerment were somewhat weaker when data were collected at different measurement points, and publication bias does not seem to be an issue in this research field. © The Authors 2022.},

Despite its omnipresence in business practice, research on agility in the domain of strategic communication is scarce. Thus, a four-step research process was conducted to link the interdisciplinary debate about agility to the field of strategic communication. First, a systematic literature review across various disciplines provided a comprehensive understanding of agility and its key dimensions. Second, several conceptual frameworks for agility were analyzed and the relevant aspects for strategic communication were synthesized. In the third step, the current impact of organizational agility on corporate communications was explored by conducting empirical in-depth interviews with chief communication officers and senior communication managers from 38 multinational companies. Finally, the theoretical, conceptual, and empirical insights were combined to develop a framework for the role of strategic communication in the context of organizational agility. The findings of this study suggest that communication departments need to: a) adopt their own structures and processes, accordingly; b) enhance organizational agility by enabling other departments; and c) communicate the agile transformation of their organization both internally and externally. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This is an extremely difficult task in the area of production processes, where the lack of a process digital footprint is a very big challenge. To solve this problem, the authors of this article designed, implemented, and verified the results of a new work measurement method. The Workplace Performance Measurement (WPM) method is focused not only on the measurement of task duration and frequency, but also on searching for potential anomalies and their reasons. The WPM method collects a wide range of workspace parameters, including workers' activities, workers' physiological parameters, and tool usage. An application of Process Mining and Machine Learning solutions has allowed us to not only significantly increase the quality of analysis (compared to analog work sampling methods), but also to implement an automated controlling solution. The genuine value of the WPM is attested to by the achieved results, like increased efficiency of production processes, better visibility of process flow, or delivery of input data to MES solutions. MES systems require good quality, frequently updated information, and this is the role played by the WPM, which can provide this type of data for Master Data as well as for Production Orders. The presented authorial WPM method reduces the gap in available scholarship and practical solutions, enabling the collection of reliable data on the actual flow of business processes without their disruption, relevant for i.a. advanced systems using AI. © The Author(s) 2024.},

This study draws on job demands-resources theory (JD-R) to understand the role of job-related training and resources on perceived work unit performance and turnover intention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), I find that workers who reported needing, but not receiving, training or resources to cope with new work roles were more likely to report a deterioration in their work unit’s performance and to report new intentions to leave their job. These effects were stronger when an employee’s demands increased over the pandemic. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing demands and resources as organizational leaders react to turbulent conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Organisations design performance evaluation systems to obtain desired work outcomes. This study analyses how subjective performance evaluation (SPE), a specific type of performance evaluation, is related to managerial work outcomes—turnover intention, organisational identification, and performance. To this end, we consider two possible mechanisms: feedback quality and trust in the supervisor. Moreover, we also consider whether adding objective performance measures to SPE alters these relationships. Based on questionnaire responses from 751 top executives and middle managers in small and medium enterprises, we find that SPE is negatively related to feedback quality, but this effect is mitigated when SPE is used jointly with objective performance measures. SPE is not directly related to trust in the supervisor when feedback quality is also considered in the analysis because the two mechanisms are inter-related—we find a positive relationship between feedback quality and trust in the supervisor. Both mechanisms are negatively related to turnover intention, but only trust in the supervisor is positively related to organisational identification. Finally, both turnover intention and organisational identification are positively related to performance. Our findings suggest that companies using SPE can improve work outcomes by adding objective performance measures to their performance evaluation system. © 2021 The Author(s).

Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to test the validity and reliability of the measures used, and a structural model was analyzed to test the hypotheses of the current study. Findings: The results indicate that agility and lean practices are significant antecedents of social sustainability orientation as well as social sustainability performance. The results also suggest that agility has a significant indirect effect on operational performance via social sustainability orientation, basic social sustainability practices as well as agility is indirectly affecting social sustainability performance via social sustainability orientation and basic social sustainability practices. Practical implications: The results of the present study have implications for managers that want to make their supply chain more socially sustainable. Originality/value: The study is unique in the sense that it empirically links agility and lean practices with social sustainability orientation, social substantiality performance and operational performance in supply chains. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The aim is to measure employee satisfaction in concrete terms and to determine the status quo of the communication culture of the organization under investigation in order to develop an employer branding strategy based on the results. The authors use an employee survey as a quantitative research method and limit the data collection to the EU member state of Germany considering the research background. The results provide insights into the specific communication policy in relation to employer branding. The focus here is on (digital) communication. Organizations need to understand how communication strategies directly influence the perception of the employer brand in the social economy. Furthermore, practical implications are derived in order to increase employer attractiveness. Concrete recommendations of action for SEOs should help them be successful in the competition for qualified specialists and talent. © 2024 by the authors.},

Our ongoing research program on digital nomadism informs a Hegelian dialectical analysis and an envisioning of the future(s) of knowledge work. We contrast the Factory paradigm of work (thesis), exemplified by the “ideal type” of the 9-to-5 corporate worker, with the Hypermobility paradigm of work (antithesis), exemplified by the ideal type of the digital nomad. Reflecting on this contrast, we envision the possible digital futures of knowledge work as a continuous spectrum, ranging from a future based on the Digital Taylorism paradigm of work to a future based on the Worker Autonomy paradigm of work. These futures are discussed in terms of different approaches to organizing work, working with technology, delineating work/life boundaries, and provisioning the social safety net. IS researchers are uniquely positioned to perform research and inform decision-making in all these areas, and thus make a difference in determining whether the future we end up with more closely resembles Digital Taylorism or the Worker Autonomy vision. © 2020 by the Association for Information Systems.},

	abstract = {Nowadays business operates in a turbulent environment, demanding quality products at low cost in short delivery times. Bearing this in mind, entrepreneurs devote special attention to define strategies, monitor entrepreneurial indicators and recruiting qualified employees. In this sense, organizations need to rely on an efficient measurement system with vast and complex information. Considering this need, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) embraces a short-, medium-and long-term time horizon and guides entrepreneurs in the measurement of their Key Performance Indicators (KPI), as acknowledged by the well-known company like Apple, which is using BSC for planning and performance measurement. Furthermore, as the KPIs need to reflect organisational performance, the interconnection of BSC with SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is considered of benefit. By means of this interlinkage, performance is monitored in an integrated way, as the flow of material and information of the whole chain is integrated and interlinked via ERP. Stressing out that several BSC implementations have failed, this research, intends to detail how ERP implementation can leverage the BSC’s features, namely to monitor entrepreneur’s strategy. As several studies have focused their attention in an isolated way and several BSC implementations failed, this research sheds light on entrepreneur’s strategy leveraged and monitored by the interrelation of ERP and BSC. © 2024, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics.

	abstract = {Individual perceptions of team trustworthiness are critical antecedents to the development of relationships within teams. Yet, clarity is needed regarding the focus of these individual perceptions and how they change, particularly at the outset of team interactions. Two distinct research streams have emerged regarding trustworthiness. One proposes a difference between perceived ability and intent, whereas the other proposes a difference between confident positive and negative expectations of others. Regardless of their structure, theory suggests that perceptions of team trustworthiness ought to develop across performance episodes as individuals identify more with their team and have more information about how they are performing. We explore these relationships across three distinct performance episodes in newly formed short-term teams. Our results support a four-factor model of trustworthiness within the context of short-term, lab-based teams. Further, perceptions regarding teammates' abilities tended to change quickly and curvilinearly while those regarding teammates' intents changed linearly. Positive team performance signals bolstered individual perceptions of team trustworthiness in ability and intent but not perceived team untrustworthiness. Negative team performance signals bolstered individual perceptions of team untrustworthiness in ability and intent while harming both types of individual perceptions of team trustworthiness. This study supports propositions from the model of trust over time and lays the groundwork for a comprehensive approach toward trust research within teams. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Much is talked and written about well-being in the workplace, but many wonder whether 'putting people first' is just a facade and that were it not for employment legislation, union representation and the high profile of human rights issues, employers would regard employees as a necessary burdensome financial evil, as in days gone by. Some scholarly research has focused on the reactions of employees to the quality of working life and well-being at work and much of this suggests high levels of dissatisfaction, disaffection and disengagement. In Workers' Voice, HRM Practice, and Leadership in the Public Sector: Multidimensional Well-Being at Work, Nicole Cvenkel avers that whilst it is known that public sector employees are even less satisfied than those in the private sector, there has been very little research into the effects of working life experiences on employee well-being in public sector organisations. There is even some doubt about whether a well-being philosophy that can be applied in the private sector can readily be extended to the public sector. The push towards New Public Management (NPM) means organisations continue to undergo significant reform processes around efficiency, costs and public service delivery. All these changes place additional demands on public sector employees who are at times also subject to intensive scrutiny by stakeholder groups, who may regard the recourse to well-being initiatives as a poor use of public funds. The author has researched in the UK local government sector and that is the setting for the debate in this book, about whether and how an employee well-being ideology can be successfully promoted and maintained in an NPM environment, given continuous reform and expenditure reduction. In a local government case organisation, the author has researched, limited resources, reduction in budgets, redundancies, increased workloads, lack of trust, and the existence of a 'controlled' working environment were all found to be central to a climate of bullying and unfairness. Although the organisation was committed to the adoption of HRM 'best practice' and initiatives geared towards promoting employees well-being, employees still believed they were being bullied and treated unfairly. It was found that different perspectives on the psychological contract, fairness, and bullying at work were highlighted by managerial and non-managerial employees. The author's conclusions contribute to a clearer understanding than hitherto of workers' voice in relation to work, leader-member exchanges, and well-being in the public sector and she offers a model depicting employees' understanding of what their quality of working life, line manager’s leadership and well-being should be, that might be used by organisational leaders, researchers, policy makers, Human Resources managers and other practitioners and consultants, to move towards a more holistic, multidimensional, well-being at work paradigm. © 2020 Taylor and Francis.},

	abstract = {Highly innovative firms are more competitive and achieve greater performance than their less innovative counterparts. Innovation orientation has been commonly used to assess an organization's innovative culture. To date, most innovation orientation research has explored its relationship with performance. However, the literature is unclear as to what innovative companies do differently to achieve superior performance. This study advances innovation orientation research by examining differing business practices of high versus low innovative Japanese firms. The various business practices include culture management, open innovation, analytics, innovation management software, crowdsourcing, design thinking, measuring innovation, stage-gate, and scientific discovery. Using data from 261 Japanese firms, this study finds that high innovators, as compared to low innovators, are more likely to engage in many of these business practices. Until this study, some of these business practices were not empirically shown to be correlated with high innovators, much less explored in the same study. This paper also offers a stepwise approach for executives seeking to enhance competitiveness via innovation. Specifically, executives should first look to creating an innovation orientation and subsequently implement such business practices. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Although existing works have investigated the influence of employee’s job insecurity on his or her perceptions or attitudes, those studies relatively have paid less attention to the influence of it on employee’s behaviors, as well as to its intermediating mechanisms of the relationship between job insecurity and the behaviors. Considering that employee’s behaviors substantially influence various organizational outcomes, I believe that studies which examine the impact of job insecurity on the behaviors as well as its underlying processes are required. Grounded on the context–attitude–behavior framework, I delved into the intermediating mechanism between job insecurity and organizational citizenship behavior with a sequential mediation model. In specific, I hypothesized that employee’s organizational trust and organizational identification would sequentially mediate the job insecurity–organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) link. Utilizing 3-wave time-lagged data from 303 employees in South Korea, I found that organizational trust and organizational identification function as sequential mediators in the link. The finding suggests that organizational trust and organizational identification are underlying processes to elaborately explain the job insecurity–OCB link. © 2019 by the authors.

Despite the efforts being made by the construction industry toward the achievement of these goals, there are still barriers that prevent built environment consultants from advancing environmental sustainability (ES) of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to identify barriers to ES of construction projects. Design/methodology/approach: An extensive literature review on barriers to the adoption of ES was conducted and face-to-face semi-structured interviews of purposively selected built environment consultants in Ghana were carried out. Thematic template analysis of qualitative data was conducted. Findings: The key findings from the study include perceived initial costs, lack of knowledge on ES, technological difficulties, external pressures in adopting ES practices and environmental conditions in developing countries. Originality/value: The outputs of this study offer strategies which are very significant to the construction industry in embracing ES. Further, the findings contribute to knowledge on achieving the sustainable development agenda. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The literature in the field of accounting establishes that accounting actively changes due to its adaptability to new roles and its fulfilling of functions that members of diverse societies have needed. While accounting is a means that has assisted humans in monitoring resources and holding delegated individuals who administer such resources accountable, it is, however, also being tested to account for human activities with nature. In practice, users of corporate reports need to be informed about the sustainability of the firms in which they invest. Inquiring about sustainability is understudied and experiences low voluntary disclosure. Since reporting on sustainability embraces financial and non-financial disclosure, this study brings to attention the enterprise concept that best fits the conceptualization of accounting at this current time, enabling the accounting profession to meet the urgent ecological, environmental, and social needs of society from reporting entities, primarily those entities whose beneficiaries are part of society. Accounting is the only tool that a business possesses to monitor its internal affairs, administer its external relations, and assess its performance. Adopting the enterprise theory enables accounting to maintain its superiority as a device that meets the emerging needs of business and society. In this regard, accounting is a sustainable profession, because it maintains its existence by assisting corporations in meeting the obligations that they owe toward members of their society and reporting the impact of their actions on members of society at large.

	abstract = {This study develops a process model of how accounting may come to an end. Grounded in a longitudinal study of a risk culture survey, this model focuses on the dynamics that underpin the repetition of accounting practices, and sheds light on two boundary conditions of successful repetition and continuation, which are in tension with each other. On the one hand, there are pressures for repetition that preserves continuity and comparability. On the other hand, there is the ongoing organizational need to adjust accounting practices. Iterating between the case study findings, social studies of accounting, and the sociology of replication in scientific practice, the model shows how moving too close to either boundary increases the risk that repetition undermines the accounting practice being repeated: “perfect repetition” may be perceived as uninteresting and decision-irrelevant; very “imperfect repetition” may be perceived as something too different and idiosyncratic, and hence also decision-irrelevant. As a result, the analysis extends a rich literature that has examined empirical instances of failure of the conditions that sustain the repeatability of accounting practices. Via the theory of “self-undermining repetition,” this study shows how the possibilities for accounting's ending are paradoxically inherent in the very act of repetition. This notion of “self-undermining repetition” is deepened by a discussion of how it may be affected by four contingencies: task ambiguity, organizational politics, organizational actors' reflexivity, and external networks of support. Overall, the analysis of the self-undermining dynamics of repetition and related contingencies contrasts with research that foregrounds the constitutive nature of repeated uses of accountings. It shows how repetition may also undermine, rather than cumulatively consolidate, accounting practices. © 2022 The Authors.

This book examines effects of national and organisational cultures on the whistleblowing decisions of employees. The book provides empirical evidence of association between organisational culture and whistleblowing and there appears to be a lower likelihood of whistleblowing in organisations that focus more on the cultural dimensions of respect for people, innovation and stability. It also illustrates how remaining silent or blowing the whistle in response to observed wrongdoings affects employees’ key work-related attitudes.

Results based on data collected from 152 middle managers using the original GLOBE research instruments indicate that Pakistani society exhibits high power distance and in-group collectivism but low assertiveness and gender egalitarianism. The results also indicate a desire to create a more egalitarian society; however, people appear to treasure the lack of assertiveness and high in-group loyalty. In light of these findings, the authors offer implications for management in Pakistan, in accordance with cross-cultural management literature.

For this test, the power HiL system and the accuracy of its impedance emulation are found to be of most relevance. The results for the test items Frequency Control and Synthetic Inertia were found to be more sensitive to shortcomings of the mechanical HiL with its control system.

Datification work could both facilitate and hinder the pursuit of meaningfulness, yet literature provides little guidance into the nature of the connection and how it transpires.

We advance current theory on work meaningfulness by theorizing the role of a new work condition – datification – in meaningfulness experiences of professionals, outlining how system design and the institutional context become important elements influencing meaningful work experiences, and explaining how meaningfulness experiences are constructed through system appropriations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies},

Even though there has been a lot of investment in information technology (IT), it's still unclear how much these investments improve productivity. This study thoroughly examines research papers, journals, and conference reports from the past ten years to assess the effect of information systems on the performance of government workers in different areas. Following the reporting standard for systematic evidence syntheses (ROSES), a detailed search was conducted using databases such as Web of Science and Scopus. The study uses the PICo (population, interest, and context) strategy to identify key areas of focus, such as Skill development, return on investment (ROI), strategic decision-making, and innovative thinking. This research plays a crucial role in developing policies and guiding the deployment of information systems to enhance the effectiveness of government officials and other stakeholders. It also looks into factors and situations that might improve or weaken the impact of IS on performance in government contexts. The outcomes of this systematic review help in understanding the complex relationship between information systems and the performance of government workers more clearly. The findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers, government organizations, and scholars, offering strategies to make the most of information systems to improve government workers' performance and productivity. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {The study measures the resource use efficiency of diesel based power generation in the Maldives and analyses factors which influence efficiency levels. Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique is applied to data on 30 plants over two year period from 2016 to 2017. The study finds that technical efficiency scores varies from 0.44 to 0.98 across power plants. About 33 percent of the plants have scores below the mean technical efficiency score of 0.87. Empirical results indicate ownership and use of solar photovoltaic (PV) have an influence on improving efficiency levels. Privately owned power plants in resort islands obtained higher technical efficiency scores compared to public and community owned power plants. This is a significant finding as the first study that used power plants in tourist sector in a comparative study. Size of the power plants was not found significant, but relatively small installed capacities can also be efficient. This finding is important because in many inhabited islands installed capacities remain oversized compared to the load. The benchmarking exercise offers model power plants that are relatively efficient, for other power plants and policy makers in small islands to learn from. © Korean Distribution Science Association (KODISA).},

The research contemplates two experimental studies, in which different brands were used in different product categories. Based on the results of the experiments, we verified the moderating effect of the perceived purchase complexity and the mediating effect of perceived social risk in the relationship between the perception of ethical problems related to a brand and the declared purchase intention, both by university students and by real consumers. Through the analysis of means differences and conditional models analyzed with PROCESS (Hayes, 2012), we identified that the perception of ethical problems related to a brand affects consumer confidence and, in some cases, the perception of product quality. In addition, we find that for products with low purchasing complexity, the effect of ethical problems is mitigated both in relation to the purchase intention and in the formation of the perception of social risk linked to consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper investigates self-management teams' implementation and its effects on performance. A Brazilian cosmetics company case study of team development was used as a guidance for this investigation. Originality: Consistent connection between team development theory and practice, exploring sociotechnical approach and empowerment best practices. Research method: Boxplot analysis is performed over team building stages along with One-way Variance Analysis to test average performance differences among stages' transitions. Tukey test was sequentially applied to identify its statistic differences in pairs. Descriptive analysis and Analysis of Means are complementarily applied for shop-floor accidents performance assessment. Main findings: Team development reached the expected performance over team stages. Forming to storming, though, was the only transition with no performance average gains. Storming to norming was the highest improvement, which meets sociotechnical principles. Moreover, mean of accidents was inferior at performing stage comparing to the overall mean of accidents during the whole project, highlighting additional shop-floor safety improvements enhanced by the new work design. Implications for theory and practice: This paper is restricted to a single sociotechnical environment. Therefore, generic conclusions imply further investigation. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, internal crisis communication (ICC) has experienced significant advancements and transformations due to various factors, including technological developments, changing communication landscapes, and the increasing need for effective crisis management within organizations. Crises have impacted organizations differently worldwide, placing management under tremendous pressure to communicate their decisions to employees and provide encouraging messages amidst the uncertainty. Based on prior theoretical and empirical research, this paper explores the cause-and-effect relationships between the antecedents of internal crisis communication and their consequences from a managerial perspective in the workplace. This research proposes a new conceptual framework that integrates multiple key factors in internal crisis communication, offering a comprehensive approach to studying the interplay between antecedents and consequences. The framework specifically examines how three antecedents—safety culture, work engagement, and leadership effectiveness—influence and interact with two consequences: perceived organizational performance and employee commitment. By synthesizing these diverse elements into a cohesive model, this framework contributes to the literature on internal crisis communication in several ways. First, it enables the examination of both direct and indirect relationships between antecedents and consequences, potentially revealing new insights into the complexities of crisis communication dynamics. Second, it provides a structured approach for future empirical studies to test and validate these relationships in various organizational contexts. Lastly, it offers a research agenda to advance the study of internal crisis communication, aiding both academics and practicing managers in developing strategies to mitigate uncertainty during crises.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine how instructional videos produced by retail employers and tech companies have modelled cashier roles and skills in service encounters over time, providing insights into cashier training and job responsibility evolution across different retail eras. Design/methodology/approach: Online video research is used, with YouTube as data source and the theory of practice architectures and related concepts as analytical framework, to examine 50 instructional video narratives produced between 1917 and 2021. Findings: Cashiers’ selling practice comprises transactions and customer service, which are often taught separately. Technology has explicitly influenced changes in cashier work and training at three points in history: mechanised checkout (1917), computerised checkout (1980) and connected checkout (2010). “New technology” involves a combination of arrangements with the potential to transform the semantic, physical and social dimensions of cashiers’ selling practice. However, despite technological advancements, employers’ cashier training videos have not evolved significantly since the 1990s and still focus on emotional labour skills. Practical implications: The findings indicate a need for transforming training for service work in the connected service encounter. Originality/value: The relationship between technological innovations and changes in frontline service work and workplace learning is examined through the lens of instructional videos produced by retail employers and tech companies, giving rise to insights into limitations of current training methods for service workers. This paper suggests the need for a more holistic perspective on service encounters to understand service work and workplace learning changes. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to propose a basis upon which accounting reporting can be developed to reflect real values and the real economy. It aims to address the environmental considerations discussed in the UN debate (Bebbington and Unerman, 2020) and the concern for a “better life-world”, which is the theme of this special issue. Design/methodology/approach: Addressing the task involves the application of the philosophy of pragmatic constructivism (which explains how people can relate to their reality in ways that lead to successful action) and the philosophical concept of the “good life” (which establishes the values to be pursued through action and so defines action success). Also, it outlines the necessary characteristics of measurement frameworks if they are to be effective in the development and control of human practices to achieve desired values. Findings: This paper proposes a conceptual framework for guiding the measurement of how a sustainable good life has improved and/or deteriorated as a result of organisational activities. It outlines a system of concepts on basic and instrumental values for analysing the condition of maintaining a sustainable good life in real terms. This is related to the financial results and societal regulations to analyse and adjust controls according to the real economic goals. Also, it provides a system of value measurands to produce valid information about the development of a sustainable good life. The measurand makes accounting reporting reflect the conditions of the good life that constitute the real economy instead of merely the financial economy driven by shareholder capitalism. Providing tools to analyse whether the existing practices of business and social regulations promote or counteract the real economic goals of producing a sustainable good life means the measurement system proposed makes the invisible hand of the market visible. Originality/value: The mechanism proposed to enable accounting reporting to reflect real values and the real economy is a new conceptual framework that will allow accounting to more fully realise its potential to contribute to a “better world”. In aiming to serve a sustainable good life, accounting reporting will inherently foster ethical social practices. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Theoretically, we establish the nexus between relative intuition and social entrepreneurship orientation as well as the moderating roles of exploratory and exploitative learning and personal identity. Empirical validation of these nexuses was based on a cross-section of 276 certified social enterprises in China. The findings indicate that social entrepreneurs' relative intuition has a positive association with social entrepreneurship orientation. Exploratory and exploitative learning positively mediate the nexus between relative intuition and social entrepreneurship orientation. In addition, personal identity positively moderates the effects of exploratory and exploitative learning on social entrepreneurship orientation. Subsequently, we found that the link between relative intuition and social entrepreneurship orientation strengthens as the social entrepreneurs' personal identity increases. In this light, we identify relative intuition as the foundation of exploratory and exploratory learning for the development of social entrepreneurship orientation. Similarly, we shed light on how personal identity positively facilitates the roles of these factors by arousing dedication to the processes/stages of the pursuit of social entrepreneurship orientation goal attainment. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Drawing on concepts from social identity theory, we investigate the tension of duality between the academic identity and the entrepreneur identity. We contend that an indirect nonlinear relationship exists between social identity continuity and academic entrepreneurship performance through identity conflict, and that another indirect nonlinear relationship exists between experiences of multiple identities and academic entrepreneurship performance through identity conflict. We conducted an empirical survey of 246 academic entrepreneurs in China and found that our hypotheses were largely supported. Theoretically, our study offers new insights into the paradox of academic entrepreneurs and hybrid founder identities. Additionally, it also enriches the extant literature on identity conflict.

	abstract = {The maritime industry, responsible for moving approximately 90% of the world’s goods, significantly contributes to environmental pollution, accounting for around 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This review explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting sustainability within the maritime sector, focusing on shipping and port operations. By addressing emissions, optimizing energy use, and enhancing operational efficiency, AI offers transformative potential for reducing the industry’s environmental impact. This review highlights the application of AI in fuel optimization, predictive maintenance, route planning, and smart energy management, alongside its role in autonomous shipping and logistics management. Case studies from Maersk Line and the Port of Rotterdam illustrate successful AI implementations, demonstrating significant improvements in fuel efficiency, emission reduction, and environmental monitoring. Despite challenges such as high implementation costs, data privacy concerns, and regulatory complexities, the prospects for AI in the maritime industry are promising. Continued advancements in AI technologies, supported by collaborative efforts and public–private partnerships, can drive substantial progress towards a more sustainable and efficient maritime industry. © 2024 by the authors.},

In light of this main objective, based on the current state of research, the study develops a maturity model to assess the SW organizational readiness (SWOR). The SWOR maturity model consists of three dimensions, each of them further detailed into two sub-dimensions. A tool was developed to make use of the model. Design/methodology/approach: The SWOR maturity model was converted into a Web-based questionnaire that includes 54 questions based on 44 items to operationalize the model sub-dimensions. The questionnaire was used in a survey conducted at the Local Health Authority (ASL) of the province of Bari (Italy). Findings: Several implications derive from the present study. From a managerial perspective, the SWOR maturity model supports companies in the as-is analysis of processes, technologies and human resources, which are the enablers of an effective SW, and in the development of a roadmap to achieve a desired “to-be” situation. Originality/value: Despite recent studies on SW have identified the key drivers that affect the success of SW implementation, there is a lack of models and tools that help companies become aware of the actions and investments to be taken to move towards an effective SW adoption. Even the analysis of the literature on maturity models reveals a gap in the research related to the assessment of SW organizational readiness. The present paper tries to overcome these limitations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It signifies the importance of developing competency-based performance concept in organizations. Since conventional performance management systems (PMSs) are diminishing and as organizations are looking for breakthrough PMSs, this research attempted to fill the gap from stakeholder’s perspective – employee, manager and organization in devising new approach in PMS. Design/methodology/approach: The research design involved developing scale for “competency-based superior performance” and validating scale for “organizational effectiveness,” The data for this survey are collected from 292 respondents through structured questionnaire. Hypotheses depicting aforementioned relationships were empirically tested in the context of competency-based performance practices in organizations based in India. Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used for data analysis. Findings: The empirical results provide methods to accelerate the performance management initiatives based on a leadership competency model (LCM), which are necessary for building performance culture in the organization. The paper contributes by developing a new scale for measuring competency-based performance practices. The scale for OE is revisited. A positive relationship between competency-based superior performance and OE with productivity, adaptability and flexibility has been empirically confirmed using SEM. Research limitations/implications: The paper limits the performance measurement concept using leadership competencies. Practical implications: The developed model will act as a building block for performance measurement in organizations. This paper promotes LCM to be applied in creating a performance-based culture. Originality/value: This is a unique attempt to test the relationship between competency-based performance management and OE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The focal aim of the project was to assess the economic anxiety (EA) and the performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during partial and full lockdowns in Kuwait. The challenges facing the SMEs during COVID-19 and the potential solutions were also explored. The call for this vital investigation was due to the global economic fallout and the shocking drop within the marketplace caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive approach was used for online survey design to collect datasets from 147 SMEs spanning all governorates of Kuwait in the period between March and June 2021. It included sociodemographic data, economic anxiety perception, potential challenges and solutions to SMEs, and SMEs’ performance. The data analysis using SPSS 25 showed that 78.2% of the SMEs were affected directly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and about 83% were affected negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, only 12.2% experienced a positive impact, mainly medical, technology, social media, food supplies, and delivery or logistics industries. With great concerns of SMEs for all dimensions related to economic anxiety (with an average of around 3.95), the greatest concerns were the financial and cash flow, followed by labor shortage (an average between 4.51 and 5.00). The results also showed that most of the performance indicators for the SMEs were low (with an average of less than or equal to 2.5), and more than 66% of them worked fewer hours during the pandemic; the number of operating hours was dropped dramatically. More than 74% of the SMEs used technology in more than 20% of their activities, representing an increase in using technologies of about 44%, and about 25.2% used social networks in more than 80% of their activities. The performance of SMEs is also found to be significantly and positively correlated with the economic anxiety levels, with a correlation coefficient of 0.186. The findings revealed significant and crucial outcomes for policymaking, decision-makers, and governmental agencies to build recovery plans and proper actions needed to manage the consequences caused by the disaster against the economic and other developments within the context of SMEs. Overall, there is a clear need to find ways and customize operations to adapt to the new work modes that require social distancing, online operations, and site management. In addition, new alternative modes of SMEs work follow to compensate for the lower working hours from the office and increased online working from home. © 2022 by the authors.

These new work policies are marked by the introduction of innovative working tools commonly known as Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical reflection on the technological changes and psychological health at work. From a corpus of articles and books published in management and psychology journals (English and French), several categories of ICTs in organizations are explored. These ICTs lead from a rigid organization to a flexible one. They enable organizations to maximize productive capacities, reduce intermediate management, recompose work collectives and develop the versatility of employees. These arrangements also change the nature, modalities and content of the work to be carried out. Beyond that, ICTs give workers the opportunity to renew their skills, open up new fields of action, broaden the space for autonomy and increase efficiency. But at the same time, these technologies can also involve more control and pressure, increase intensification factors and considerably reduce the scope for maneuver and expression of the trade; exposing the psychological health of employees to risks such as stress and burn out. © 2018 Société Française de Psychologie},

Six attributes (academic degree and level, among others) are used to describe the candidate profiles. The data were analysed through a multinomial logit model and an ordinary least squares regression model that highlighted the preferred characteristics of the candidates for the considered job positions. The main findings show that recruitment in accommodation facilities looks at specialized skills and academic programmes appropriate for the specific job positions.

The paper also attempts to discuss and then seek empirical evidence to the two mediational paths (namely, career commitment and job satisfaction) that explain the focal relationship between job workload and academic performance. To test the three proposed hypotheses, the study used cross-sectional data collected from academic staff serving in Malaysian Research Universities (MRUs). The final sample of 191 valid and complete responses was analysed using SmartPLS 3.3.3 to test the hypotheses. Results showed that workload is negatively related to academic staff performance. In addition, job satisfaction mediates workload and academic staff performance linkage. These findings reinforce the importance of job satisfaction as an influencing factor against the deleterious effect of job workload and academic staff performance. The study has shown that, contrary to our expectations, career commitment does not mediate the relation between job workload and academic staff performance. Going forward, this study provides new insights about the effect of job workload on the performance of university academic staff through intervening variables. © 2011. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {As society evolves, moving forward into the realms of Industry 5.0, it is imperative to develop a robust collaborative talent management model that can endure external crises such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the antiquity of collaborative practices—traceable back to early human societies—both practitioners and academics have frequently focused primarily on exploring the catalysts for collaboration, often neglecting to provide a holistic conceptualization of effective human collaboration. In alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, this paper endeavors to critically review and delineate the evolution of talent management and collaborative intelligence literature. Employing a systematic review methodology, this study aims to formulate a novel framework for collaborative talent management, drawing upon the principles of a collaborative intelligence mindset, and to suggest avenues for future research in this domain. The findings propose the employment of collaborative intelligence through a mindset perspective as a means to bridge the literature gaps identified in areas such as interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration, digitalization and artificial intelligence, collaborative leadership styles, and performance measurement within the field. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Team diversity has emerged as an essential concept in the field of project management. In a diverse climate, team members have different thinking capacities, knowledge, perspectives, and strategies that help to create new ideas. But sometimes, this diversity causes conflicts among the team members, ultimately creating tension, resentment, and loathing behavior at the workplace. Therefore, the current study attempts to understand the relationship between team diversity (knowledge, value) and project performance through trust and absorptive capacity. Data were collected from team members involved in IT (Information Technology) projects. Findings reveal that team diversity enhances project performance through trust and absorptive capacity. But the relationship is partially mediated in the case of value diversity and fully mediated with knowledge diversity. This study contributes to the IT sector, where dynamic team members utilize their innovative capabilities and problem-solving skills for achieving project success. © 2021},

Analysis of the most recent yet more vulnerable disasters have pointed out that the relief workers often created a difference. Lack of appropriate access to standardized models to train the relief workers has created a need to develop a competency model that can further be validated with the relief organizations to create a standard. The current study aims to develop and test a hypothetical model that proposes a relationship between the competencies of the emergency relief workers, job performance, and job satisfaction through empirical analysis of primary data. The study reveals a good relationship between the competencies, job performance, and job satisfaction and shows a significant impact of the three variables on each other.

Design/methodology/approach: This study follows a systematic, transparent and replicable approach suggested by Vom Brocke et al. (2009) to conduct a systematic review. A total of 52 empirical studies published over the years 1999–2019 was retrieved and analyzed. Findings: Three key themes related to the OL–FP relationship have emerged from the review. First, research on OL and FP has been quantitatively conducted in a variety of countries and sectors. Second, dimensions of OL foster both financial and non-financial performance of firms through their combinations and interactions. Third, the relationship between OL and FP is mediated by organizational innovation. Research limitations/implications: The literature search returned only quantitative studies on OL and FP, which was accepted within the scope of this review. Future studies are encouraged to systematically examine case studies and qualitative research on OL and FP. Practical implications: This review demonstrates that FP can be improved through different dimensions of OL. Based on our findings, managers wanting to enhance the performance of their firms can analyze the demand for OL and develop those OL dimensions. Originality/value: This is among the first systematic literature reviews on OL and FP. The findings of this study also contribute to the previously scattered understanding of OL and FP. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of a private jet company’s change of workplace on employees’ satisfaction using specific variables from a conceptual framework of workplace change appraisal. Another purpose of the study is to identify the relationships between staff characteristics and satisfied aspects of a work environment. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was conducted at MJets – a company in the aviation and private jet sector. The research methods included field surveys, document analysis and a set of questionnaires on employee satisfaction, which were then analysed and discussed. Findings: The findings show that organisational contexts, work processes and implementation processes have an impact on workplace change and employees’ needs and preferences, which affect their responses to the work environment. The most satisfied aspects of a work environment include the ceiling height of each floor, the square-metre area of buildings and the amount of light in the work area. Despite the new work environment, employees are scarcely satisfied with building accessibility, storage, archive facilities and privacy. The relationships between staff characteristics (i.e. working hours, job functions, mode of transport and duration of employment) and employee satisfaction with the work environment are statistically tested. The study shows statistically significant results including the following: mode of transport and satisfaction with parking spaces, job functions and satisfaction with building accessibility and job functions and satisfaction with storage and archive facilities. Research limitations/implications: According to a business type, the provision and arrangement of the work environment of a private jet company that is different from other office organisations affect both the generalisation and the generalisability of the study. This study was conducted in Thailand. The impact of the national culture may have also influenced the outcomes. Practical implications: The findings and the reflections upon them help understand the complex relationships of variables influencing workplace change appraisal. The focus is on employee involvement; communication with employees in the preparation and implementation processes may be an effective way to promote workplace change objectives and help facility managers reduce negative impacts of workplace change. Originality/value: This paper contributes to prior research on workplace change appraisal and provides evidence for both positive and negative impacts of workplace change on employee satisfaction with the work environment. Identifying the impact of workplace change on employee satisfaction through the conceptual framework contributes to the body of research on facilities management. In addition, the conceptual framework of workplace change appraisal can be applied by practitioners in the field of workplace design and management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We progress to discussing more structured and comprehensive PM processes that typically involve cascading goals, goal setting, competency modeling, evaluation of behavior and results, and implementation. These systems have proven to be tedious and low-value, resulting in unprecedented, wide-spread experimentation with innovative practices to move companies away from heavy PM processes to simpler, cost-effective strategies that actually drive performance. These have ranged from abandoning ratings to implementing innovations in goal-setting, real-time feedback, coaching, and PM behavior change.

Organizational leaders are continuously facing the challenge of communicating their strategic goals to their stakeholders. Very often, they are adopting performance management tools to meet this challenge. Consequently, this chapter explains that the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) can be used to evaluate and measure the firms’ corporate communications and their organizational performance. This tool has been widely recognized by academics and managers as it is capable of aligning organizational strategies (including their missions and visions), strategic indicators (leading and lagging indicators) and stakeholder management. A review of the relevant literature review suggests that many practitioners are becoming strategic in their corporate communications. In this light, this chapter clarifies that the BSC approach can be used to support them in their stakeholder engagement.

	abstract = {Background: Only one in 10 newly established business enterprises survives for longer than 10 years in the South African business environment. The primary reasons behind the demise of these small enterprises include the lack of access to financing, lack of financial and managerial skills, lack of expertise, as well as economic factors such as poor sales and weak growth prospects. The new norm in industrial markets is that business organisations must possess a remarkable amount of agility to survive and succeed. Success is important for South African small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) given their significant contributions to the national economy. Objectives: This study investigated the connection between organisational agility, business best practices and the performance of SMEs in South Africa. Method: A quantitative approach using the cross-sectional survey research design was employed in which a structured questionnaire was administered to 564 randomly selected owner-managers of SMEs. Hypotheses were tested using the structural equation modelling procedure, which was conducted after implementing a confirmatory factor analysis to test the psychometric properties of the measurement scales. Results: Hypotheses tests indicated that the four business best practices, namely, technology capability, collaborative innovation, organisational learning and internal alignment, exerted a significant positive influence on organisational agility. Also, organisational agility exerted a significant positive influence on business performance. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the performance of SMEs can be improved significantly through a proper alignment between the four business best practices considered in this study. Improving the level of organisational agility in SMEs is also important in stimulating their performance. The results of the study can be applied to assist SMEs to survive and flourish in turbulent and dynamic markets, where agile organisational abilities are a requirement for success. © 2019.

	abstract = {Information technology has brought about significant changes in enterprises, and new work situations have led to new problems. Employee resistance to new technologies, their ability to learn, and their ability to utilize personal resources to improve work engagement in the face of technological pressure are important factors that companies need to consider when undergoing digital transformation. The influence mechanism of configuration effects on factors around employee work engagement has not been explored, and technostress creators have rarely been included in the configuration as influencing factors in previous studies. On the basis of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and trait activation theory, this study explored the factors that affect employees’ work engagement at the level of job demands and personal resources. The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method was used to investigate the influence of technical stressors, self-efficacy, and the Big Five personality traits on employees’ work engagement. Through a survey of 225 employees in the context of enterprise digital transformation, the results show three driving paths that promote employees’ work engagement: openness to experience conscientiousness, self-efficacy driven, and inhibition to technical stressors. The study also analyzed employees’ low work engagement state, which is driven by an inhibition of agreeableness and extraversion. This research enriches the study of factors influencing work engagement in the digital transformation of enterprises. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The human and technology have integrated, and distinctive characteristics of different societies have intertwined with technology. Thus, technology constitutes the reflection of the society, where it exists, in economic, social, and political domains. The desires, expectations, and needs of people have affected the change of technology in time. This effect contains different domains in itself. Life has changed since the 1980s under the leadership of means of informatics, and following the 1990s, internet technology have opened the doors of an informatics era whose effect is being highly sensed today. In addition to its importance, it creates significant changes and effects on individuals, society, culture, and other domains. When significant changes in technology and digitalization have combined with the globalization of information and communication, the resulting problems have begun to spread faster. In this study, which was performed for examining the digital conflicts arising in business infrastructure, literature was reviewed thoroughly. In the first part of the study, the conceptual framework of business infrastructure was examined and tried to be clarified. Moreover, it was intended to convey the commencement of the technologies used, and their following processes. Then, it was urged upon clarifications regarding business processes and digitalization of business processes, and by referring to the implementations of technologies - used in business processes - in the domain of digitalization, structural examinations were conveyed from the literature. Finally, the issues of digital conflicts and cyber security occurring in business infrastructure, which are being expressed as more prominent factors, were clarified. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Using a sample of survey data collected from middle-level managers in Australia, this study finds that managers passively receive performance information and perceive high-quality feedback when their performance is evaluated based on FPMs and that they proactively seek feedback when their performance is evaluated based on NFPMs. The results of the study also show that neither NFPMs nor FPMs are directly associated with individual creativity. However, the study finds that (1) the positive association between NFPMs and individual creativity is fully mediated by feedback-seeking behavior and perceived feedback quality together, and (2) the positive association between FPMs and individual creativity is fully mediated by perceived feedback quality alone. Further, the results indicate that feedback-seeking is not only a catalyst for perceived feedback quality but also a self-regulation strategy that facilitates individual creativity. In sum, the study offers initial empirical evidence of the passive feedback effect of FPMs and the proactive feedback effect of NFPMs on feedback and individual creativity. © 2023 European Accounting Association.},

This research addresses the knowledge gap related to how teams effectively overcome disruptions in collaborative projects in order to reach resilience. The study explores the relationships amongst three interconnected constructs— equivocality, governance, and interorganizational learning— as key factors to be considered during perturbations. A systemic perspective using the lenses of complex adaptive and generative systems (complexity theory) has been approached. Using a cross-case analysis, the research's contribution is summarized through a model that offers explanations into how a successful case (the LOCUTIOS project) overcame effectively two instances of perturbations, within a high-uncertainty context. The model proposes two different reaction patterns, characterized by different learning behaviours (adaptive or generative), governance approaches (complementarity or substitution), and role of equivocality (driver or barrier) to knowledge exploration. Highlights of various forms of resilience within collaborative projects when unknown unknowns arise were exposed. © 2023 The Authors},

Using a Foucauldian approach, we undertook a longitudinal analysis of TELT to investigate the accounting and performance challenges faced as this hybrid organisation attempted to meet the diverse goals and values of multiple stakeholders. The technologies introduced new work planning techniques, excavating, building prototypes, estimating and certifying standard costs, and implementing time and space controls based on cost classifications. The idea behind all these measures was to normalise the risks associated with the megaproject, and thus zero any cost overruns during the project's lifecycle. TELT's ‘winning spirit’ succeeded in navigating a bi-national business value chain spanning governments, contractors, and sub-contracting companies. Different forms of reporting were used concurrently – some for financial disclosure, others for auditing to comply with national and European auditing regulations as enforced by the two governments. Non-financial information was also disclosed to diverse, and sometimes conflicting stakeholders, to increase social value and reduce information asymmetry. The study reveals how a wide range of experts intervened to solve problems at the meso-political and micro-organisational levels. © 2022 British Accounting Association},

The study was based on the epistemology of interpretivism and social constructive approaches. The results show that HRM and MA are two different business functions but have intersecting and overlapping roles and responsibilities within the organisation. Therefore, the hybridisation of strategies between HRM and MA in formulating a more effective and efficient FWAs implementation plan is appropriate.

Moreover, in order to have more specific look on building blocks of DSC, a framework for digital supply chain is designed considering the value stream in DSC. The framework consists of several layers, including DSC strategies, enablers, processes, data management and analytics, DSC flows and DSC features. These components work seamlessly to provide virtual values for customers and other stakeholders. Finally, managerial implications and future research directions are remarked. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

In line with this ongoing conversation fuelled notably by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated digital acceleration, in this paper, we lay out the case for how “actively embracing disorganization” as a new work form can be a mechanism that facilitates the creation and enactment of important dynamic capabilities thus enhancing a firm’s ability to cope with unpredictable environments. In doing so, we attempt to make a novel contribution outlining the relationship between disorganization and dynamic capabilities through propositions and an accompanying conceptual framework.

To address the research gap on green development assessment systems, this study first presents the Super-efficiency Bounded Adjusted Measure model to gage the green growth index and economic growth index. This analysis involves evaluation of the coupling coordination degree. Through the analysis of the coordination between green growth and economic growth leads to recommendations for each region under consideration in regards to promotion of the components of the sustainable growth. This study presents the model that melds the objectives of the green and economic growth and uses the results for constructing the sustainable development Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient for the analysis of the differences in the sustainable development levels across the regions.

	abstract = {Purpose: Women are underrepresented in most university entrepreneurship education (EE) programmes and less likely than men to pursue business venturing as a career. One reason may be the “entrepreneurial identity gap”, whereby female students do not see themselves as successful entrepreneurs. This paper aims to explore the nature of this identity gap and its relationship to entrepreneurial intent and entrepreneurship education. Design/methodology/approach: A set of contemporary, gender-inclusive entrepreneurial attributes was developed using entrepreneurial subject matter experts and tested with 591 university students to explore the nature of the gendered entrepreneurial identity gap. Findings: While masculine stereotypes persist and the entrepreneurial identity gap is larger for female students, results suggest that a more gender-inclusive vocabulary of entrepreneurship is emerging among the student population and an androgynous perception of the idealized entrepreneur. Entrepreneurship education had a positive influence on entrepreneurial intent. Research limitations/implications: Study findings advance the conversation about entrepreneurial identity, the nature of the gendered identity gap and the role of education in closing that gap. The questionnaire and set of gender-inclusive attributes should continue to be tested beyond student samples. Practical implications: Based on this study, entrepreneurship education could benefit from more gender-inclusive instructional practices and vocabulary and a broadened definition of what it means to be entrepreneurial. More students – both men and women – will see themselves as entrepreneurs and be inspired to participate in the innovation economy. Originality/value: This study takes a novel approach to the study of entrepreneurial identity, developing a new set of attributes and contemporary vocabulary around business venturing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This current study examined the effect of LMX and WE on IT employees’ citizenship behaviour mediated by OJE. Design/methodology/approach: The sample has been taken from 430 employees of IT organizations located in India. The data were analysed through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Besides, Preacher and Hayes’ (2004) mediation analysis technique has been used to analyse the mediating role of OJE. Findings: The study findings reveal significant association between the key study variables. Organizational job embeddedness (OJE partially mediated the relationship between organizational factors such as LMX, WE and OCB. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights to better understand the antecedents of OJE and how it influences employees’ citizenship behaviour. Exploring the relationship among key study variables may have significant implications for organizations. The researchers and human resource practitioners may use the proposed investigation framework to formulate human resource practices and interventions to develop the job embeddedness, which can further promote citizenship behaviour among employees. Originality/value: First, the present study has focussed on the IT sector organizations based in India that have not been explored much regarding the study variables, as previous studies focussed more on Western countries. Second, the current study outspreads the preceding research by examining the OJE as a mediator between LMX, WE and OCB. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this work, a methodology for the design of deep learning-based signal preprocessing strategies that simplify music signals and emphasize rhythmic information is proposed. It combines harmonic/percussive source separation and deep neural network (DNN) based source separation in a versatile source mixture model. Two different neural network architectures were assessed with regard to their applicability for this task. The method was evaluated with instrumental measures and in two listening experiments for both network architectures and six mixing presets. Normal-hearing subjects rated the signal quality of the processed signals compared to the original both with and without a vocoder which provides an approximation of the auditory perception in CI listeners. Four combinations of remix models and DNNs have been selected for an evaluation with vocoded signals and were all rated significantly better in comparison to the unprocessed signal. In particular, the two best-performing remix networks are promising candidates for further evaluation in CI listeners.  © 2022 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract = {Digital nomads are engaged in a complex quest to select their next destination. In this context, user-generated content (UGC) on social media is a pivotal source to glean insights into digital nomads' destination choices. Accordingly, this study investigates the principal topics that influence digital nomad's destination choice. To this end, data-mining techniques are applied to analyze user-generated content (UGC) from the social platform X (former Twitter). Based on the results, we identify a total of 11 topics associated with digital nomads' location preferences that can be grouped into 3 clusters (positive, negative, and neutral). Specifically, we find six positive topics (employment, retirement, gastronomy, co-working, work motivation, culture), one neutral topic (customer service), and four negative topics (connectivity, work hours, visa issues, loneliness). The results suggest that job flexibility, the attraction of travel, and cultural immersion emerge as positive factors influencing destination choice. By contrast, connectivity concerns, visa management, feelings of isolation, and emotional adjustments stand out as considerable impediments for digital nomads. We spotlight the long-term pursuit of quality of life and technological connectivity as the main drivers of digital nomads in their destination choice. The paper concludes with a formulation of 33 research questions related to digital nomad destination decisions to be addressed in further research. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {One of the deadliest diseases in the world is skin cancer, especially melanoma. Detection and identification of this type of cancer is very difficult due to the strong similarity of its morphological characteristics with the characteristics of other skin cancer types, even with nevi. Early detection of melanoma can help in increasing the cure rate by minimizing diagnostic time and saving efforts. Different systems from deep learning are actually developed to help dermatologists early diagnose melanoma. These systems use several types of data for the classification between melanoma and non-melanoma, such as dermoscopic images and DNA or RNA genetic sequences. This paper proposes a new work that aims at recognizing melanoma lesions from non melanoma ones. The method uses the convolutional neural networks. The data we consider here are the SNP protein sequences of the human FGFR2 gene. We transform, then, these SNP sequences from their textual form into scalogram images to be taken as input to the CNN classifier. The images are encoded in different color spaces with the goal of constructing four databanks. For quantitative evaluation, we use different evaluation rates such as: accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. The values attained are very satisfactory. These results show the performance of the proposed system and demonstrate the existing relationship between the gene FGFR2 and the possible small protein changes.  © 2022 IEEE.},

User experience is, in most cases, connected with a person’s perception, person’s feelings, and satisfaction with the platform used. Data were collected using a standard UEQ questionnaire. With this research, we examined whether user experience factors: perceived efficiency, perceived perspicuity, perceived dependability, perceived stimulation, and perceived novelty affect perceived attractiveness, which is an important factor in the sustainability of e-learning tools. The collected data were processed using SmartPLS. The research study showed that all studied factors have a statistically significant impact on perceived attractiveness.

	abstract = {Neoliberalism has transformed work, welfare and democracy. However, its impacts, and its future, are more complex than we often imagine. Alongside growing inequality, social spending has been rising. Politics, Inequality and the Australian Welfare State After Liberalisation asks how we understand this contradictory politics and what opportunities exist to create a more equal society. It argues an older welfare state politics, driven by the power of industrial labour, is giving way to political contests led by workers within the welfare state itself. Advancing more equal social policy, though, requires new forms of statecraft, or ways of doing policy, as well as new models of organising. Drawing on examples of social policy change since the 1980s, the book explores how seemingly similar reforms reflect distinct political dynamics and facilitate different social outcomes. The examples reflect the main aspects of liberalisation - conditionality of benefits, marketisation of services and financialisation of the life course. Across each domain, it identifies examples that fit the 'neoliberal' frame and alternatives that appear to subvert it. From family payments to Medicare, social protection advanced using remarkably similar policy tools to those associated with liberalisation. The book identifies two competing welfare state projects. A 'dual welfare state' of hidden subsidies to privatised welfare alongside increasingly residualised public systems that stigmatise recipients, and a 'hybrid' model of marketised universalism that uses novel forms of statecraft to socialise risk while advancing competition. Rather than explaining how Australia fell prey to neoliberalism, the book identifies an ongoing struggle between competing visions of liberalisation. Dual welfare deepens inequality by concealing the distributional effects of state policy, building a sizeable coalition of largely older voters, insulated from the insecurities of precarious work and benefiting from rising house prices. Hybrid policies, it argues, emerged at the intersection of sympathetic bureaucracies and strong social pressure. Central to both are workers within the welfare state and the unions that represent them. The analysis recasts divides based on generation and education as reflecting the increasingly central role of social reproduction within the paid economy, and the strategies of care workers to have their skills and value recognised.

Using an innovative theoretical approach predicated on activity theory (AT) to dissect the problem, the book makes the case for co-created rehabilitation strategies that address the needs of offenders - which can only be achieved with the involvement of health and social welfare services as a means to provide a holistic support to individuals - and regard for the dilemmas front-line professionals face to deploy such strategies - which means shifting the top-down paradigm of policy implementation for co-created solutions. The book explores how AT can be used to help design commensurate interventions that give voice to all the interested actors involved in the rehabilitation process and provide readers with tools that help translate theory into practice. This book is essential reading for students, researchers, practitioners and other stakeholders focusing on co-created, bottom-up alternatives to imprisonment that benefit both offenders, community and the state. © 2022 Paulo Rocha.},

The core hypothesis, supported by the results, is that the more similar the initially experienced level of organizational munificence is to the level of munificence in a subsequent period, the higher an individual’s job performance. This relationship between what I call “imprint–environment fit” and performance is contingent on the individual’s career stage when entering the organization and the influence of secondhand imprinting resulting from the social transmission of others’ imprints. A possible implication of the core hypothesis may be a “curse of extremes,” whereby both very high and very low levels of initial munificence are associated with lower average performance during a person’s subsequent tenure. One mechanism underlying these patterns is that employees socialized in different resource environments develop distinct approaches to problem solving and client interactions, which then lead to varying levels of imprint–environment fit in subsequent resource environments. © The Author(s) 2014.},

However all textbooks are region-specific-except this one. This textbook takes a global viewpoint, with an international author team and cases from across the globe. Other unique features of this excellent textbook include: Placement of B2B in a strategic marketing setting; full discussion of strategy in a global setting including hypercompetition; full chapter on ethics early in the text; detailed review of global B2B services marketing, trade shows and market research; This new edition has been completely rewritten, and features expanded sections on globalisation and purchasing, plus brand new sections on social media marketing and intellectual property. More selective, shorter, and easier to read than other B2B textbooks, this is ideal for introduction to B2B and shorter courses.

We gleaned empirical data from 114 respondents in public sector organizations in Lampung, Indonesia, and analyzed it using SmartPLS to test our hypotheses. We found that in the course of budgetary participation, employees’ expectancy attitude, in the light of the expectancy theory and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, predicted employees’ behavior, and had a significant impact on their self-efficacy and performance. Employees’ voice and interpersonal trust in the budget construction process would reap optimal benefit for the organization when participating employees perceive their participation to be objectively appreciated and encouraged by top management.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to use an inter-disciplinary approach to examine the relevance of F.W. Taylor’s principles to modern shop-floor practices in the context of a manufacturing organization. Design/methodology/approach: Standard time study guidelines laid out by the ILO were adopted and random observations made between two operators independently performing an identical operation in the shop-floor premises of a particular factory. Findings: It was evident from the study that modern management has developed the science for each element of the operator’s manual work, as postulated and proposed by F.W. Taylor. It was also evident that completion of the operation on time was necessary for the operators but not as important as the total number of jobs performed during the duration of the shift. These empirical findings highlighted the high relevance of F.W. Taylor’s principles to modern shop-floor practices. Research limitations/implications: The authors adopted time study observation as the single method to collect real data from real practices but this could be considered as a biased approach. Since the time study observation is a slow, time consuming, and expensive process of obtaining data, the authors restricted the study to only two operators. Further, the study was carried out in a real setting under several assumptions that may limit its wider applications and practical implications. The study findings suggest that measuring the operator’s performance in terms of time consumption and resource utilization is necessary but not sufficient to evaluate and improve his/her productivity because operators evaluate their performance in terms of the total number of jobs completed during the duration of the shift. Therefore, it is suggested that the managers on the modern shop-floor measure the output at the aggregate level for the given input, while developing new work methods as well as devising performance management and reward systems. Originality/value: The study has contributed to the body of knowledge by conducting a complete assessment of F.W. Taylor’s first principle from its origin to its application in modern shop-floor practices. Also, the authors empirically examined the relevance of Taylor’s principles to modern shop-floor practices in the context of a manufacturing organization. The study supports the descriptive work of Freeman (1996), who envisaged the relevance of Taylor’s ideas to modern management practices; also, it gives a few directions to test behavioral operations theory in terms of using real operational data to examine an established organization theory (Gino and Pisano, 2008). © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper examines one example of innovation in the UK higher education context, namely the creation of a spinout company, and explores its implications for the individual knowledge worker. Focusing on the developing professional identities of those involved, the narrative draws on data from an ethnographic study of the birth of a university spinout company and its eventual launch as an independent company. Utilising the concept of ‘third space’ to frame the spinout experience, it argues that individuals engaging in ‘innovative’ activities of a commercial nature in higher education develop hybrid roles at the margins of their organisations. The extent to which these are tenable over the longer term is debated. © 2015 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the LH Martin Institute for Tertiary Education Leadership and Management.},

Neoliberalism is recognized as the dominant political and economic philosophy across the globe, and new managerialist, corporatized practices, as its “organizational arms,” are ubiquitous within the higher education sector worldwide. Intersecting this agenda are dramatic developments in the way university courses are being conceived and delivered based upon the increasing integration of digital technologies. Given the radical transformations brought about by Web 2.0 technologies, it is timely to critically analyze current narratives shaping the teaching and learning agenda and their impact on the nature and quality of nursing higher education. This article draws on the “McDonaldization thesis” of George Ritzer, concepts from the work of the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, Habermasian social theory, and critical pedagogy. It concludes with a short overview of possible outcomes of the new agenda, and some strategies for resistance.

Knowledge work is considered to be "distributed" whenever key decisions for execution of the project cut across organizational boundaries, as occurs under outsourcing, offshoring, or open-source arrangements. The growth of such arrangements in recent years is well documented. Nonetheless, research into maintaining the coherence of a DKW project from initiation to customer delivery, often referred to as supply chain integration, project or systems integration, or simply "integration," is relatively new. We first review the relevant literature from operations, service, and information management, organizational theory, and engineering design, focusing on the key decisions identified by this literature in relation to the contracting, organization, work, and information infrastructure design of a knowledge work project. We then attempt to open the "black box" of integration by inductively organizing these key decisions. Finally, we contrast this approach with prior research frameworks and identify key topics for future study. © 2013 Production and Operations Management Society.},

Written by a long-serving officer, Canadian Policing in the 21st Century offers a rare look at street-level police work and the hidden culture behind the badge. Robert Chrismas shares experiences from his years of service to highlight areas where police can more effectively enforce laws and improve relations with the communities they serve. He proposes tactics for addressing widespread social issues such as gang and domestic violence and strategies for cooperating in international networks tackling human trafficking, internet-based child exploitation, organized crime, and terrorism. Chrismas stresses how changing demographics related to age, gender and racial diversity, and increased dangers and demands, require intensified training and higher education in policing. He highlights the need for more effective collaborative relationships between police and local, provincial, and federal governments, non-government agencies, and their communities. While the principles and goals of policing remain largely unchanged, police challenges, tools, and strategies have evolved dramatically.

The survey instrument included measures of comprehensive sustainable performance, TLS and OC adapted from the literature. The data were analyzed through factor analysis and regression with a resampling method of bootstrapping. Findings – The findings indicated that TLS influenced hotel departments’ non-financial as well as social and environmental performance dimensions directly and indirectly through OC. However, the mediation effect of OC did not exist for financial performance. Research limitations/implications – The key theoretical contribution is the use of performance assessment based on critical success factors of hotel businesses and the bootstrapping regression model. Practical implications – Senior managers should pay attention to TLS qualities when appointing core managers, provide on-going structured TLS training and concentrate on leading performance dimensions for performance assessment.

	abstract = {In the last two decades, knowledge management has evolved through a number of different research fields and practitioner contexts. A recent development is represented by the concept of collective intelligence, as a new collaboration and socialization paradigm, thus including a relevant knowledge management component, aimed to find better solutions to human problems and societal challenges. Collective intelligence research aims to extend the methods and application fields of collective intelligence. The current world economic crisis is relevant socio-economic and cultural problem and it can be assumed to be an interesting field of analysis and a research context for experimenting approaches and systems leveraging collective intelligence. In such scenario, this paper presents a conceptual model of collective intelligence aimed to enhance the potential of a community to realize technology-based innovation and entrepreneurship processes, thus supporting the growth of regions and organizations. Based on a literature review and initial expert validation, a design science approach has been applied to define a new model and prototypal technology/service solutions aimed to enhance the creation and development of technology entrepreneurship initiatives. The main constituents of the model and the core services are presented along with a discussion of their role in entrepreneurship dynamics. A preliminary demonstration of the operationalization of the model is provided through illustrative scenarios focused on competence development and business development processes. The validation of the model and the service architecture has been preliminary done qualitatively based on domain experts whereas empirical validation represents the objective of future studies. The work can have implications at theory level, in terms of further development of the collective intelligence concept, and at practitioner level, with the proposal of a socio-technical system addressing a new generation of solutions and customerdriven services. The research was developed in the frame of a research project aimed to develop successful technology entrepreneurship ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The paper discussed the effectiveness of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and discussed various models of organizational effectiveness (OE) that have been applied in NGOs. Furthermore, different viewpoints that emerged from research over the past four decades are synthesized. The review of models and research studies revealed little agreement among the academic community to conceptualize NGO effectiveness. While early studies focused on the assessment of NGO effectiveness highlighted organizational goals, contemporary studies focused on the processes that contribute to NGO effectiveness. Most of the studies found the governing board as a common dimension of NGO effectiveness. The paper conceptualized NGO effectiveness as a multi-dimensional social construct with an ability to achieve an organizational mission through a competent governing board, strong NGO-employee relationship, and efficient financial measures. The paper concluded that it is difficult to develop a universal standard definition of NGO effectiveness because NGOs work on diverse themes, issues, scales, and approaches. On the basis of the analysis, it is suggested that future research on NGO effectiveness should focus on specific cultures, focus, and scale of NGOs. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The paper extends the organizational learning framework: Structural-Functional (SF)-single-loop or Conflictual-Radical (CR)- double-loop learning to the management accounting literature. The sociological approach of organizational learning is utilized to understand those contingent factors that can explain why management accounting innovations succeed or fail in organizations. Approach - We view learning as enhancing an organization's strategic competitive advantage by making it better able to adopt and diffuse innovation in respond to changes in its environment in order to manage improved performance. The success of management accounting innovations is contingent upon whether its learning process involves SF-singleloop or CR-double-loop learning to adopt and diffuse process innovation. Findings - The paper suggests that the learning strategy that the organization chooses is the reason why some management accounting innovations are more successfully adopted than others and why some innovations are easily diffused in some organizations but not in others. We propose that the sociological approaches to learning provide an alternative framework with which to better understand the adoption and diffusion of process innovations in management accounting systems. Originality - It has become evident that management accounting researchers need to pay particular attention to an organization's approach to adoption and diffusion of innovation strategies, particularly when they are designing and implementing process innovation programs for an organization. According to Schulz (2001), there are two interrelated stages of the learning that can shape the outcome of the innovation process in an organization. The first stage is related to the acquisition/ production (adoption) of knowledge that results in gathering information, codification, and exploration. This is followed by the second stage which is the distribution or dissemination (diffusion) processes. When these two stages - adoption and diffusion - are applied within an accounting context, they address issues that are commonly associated with the successes and/or failures of management accounting innovations. Research limitations/implications - Although innovation involves learning, the nature of the learning process does not completely describe the manner in which an innovation affects the organization. Accordingly, we suggest that the two interrelated organizational sociological dimensions of innovations processes, namely, (1) the adoption and diffusion theories of Rogers (1971 and 1995), to approach organizational learning, and (2) the SF (single loop) and CR (double loop) approaches to learning be used simultaneously to describe management accounting innovations. Practical implications - When an innovation is implemented, it initially can be introduced as an incremental change, one that can be limited in both in its scope and its breadth of administrative changes. This means that situations which are most likely to benefit from its initiation can serve as the prototype for its adoption by the organization. If successful, this can be followed by systemic accounting innovations to instituting broader administrative changes within the existing accounting reporting and control systems. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In this context, the notion of ICT self-discipline – an individual’s ability to regulate their behaviours towards ICTs – becomes pivotal in the process of managing ICT connectivity. This follow-on study reports the results of an online survey of 443 to New Zealand professionals regarding the influence of ICT self-discipline on the relationship between ICT connectivity and employee productivity.

These result from misalignment in the mental pictures that managers, employees and customers have of the service. The study demonstrates how the process of articulating a shared service concept reduces these challenges. Design/methodology/approach: A narrative methodology is used to analyze the perspectives of old management, new management and employees during organizational change in a PSF – a website design company growing to offer full-service branding. Group narratives are constructed using longitudinal data gathered through interviews and fieldwork, in order to compare the misaligned mental pictures and show the benefits of articulating the service concept. Findings: Professional employees view growth and change as threats to their culture and practice, particularly when new management seeks to standardize processes. These threats are revealed to stem from misinterpretations caused by miscommunication of intentions and lack of participation in decision making. Articulating a shared service concept helps to align understanding and return the firm to equilibrium. Research limitations/implications: The narrative methodology helps unpack conflicting perspectives, but is open to claims of subjectivity and misrepresentation. To ensure fairness and trustworthiness, informants were invited to review and approve the narratives.

We draw on theories of R&D management, organisation learning, knowledge management and strategic capability to reflect on contextual complexities that arise as a result of the nature of knowledge-based resources of research organisations. We deploy correspondence analysis and use this method to explore the structure of multivariate relationships among the different laboratories in the analysis, showing how various functions impact on effective R&D management and quality performance measured in terms of patents, publications and citations. We find that strategic innovation practices are essential for supporting pilot plants, experimental field stations and in the engineering and design units.

	abstract = {The goal of this research was the development of a practical architecture for the computer-based tutoring of teams. This article examines the relationship of team behaviors as antecedents to successful team performance and learning during adaptive instruction guided by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Adaptive instruction is a training or educational experience tailored by artificially-intelligent, computer-based tutors with the goal of optimizing learner outcomes (e.g., knowledge and skill acquisition, performance, enhanced retention, accelerated learning, or transfer of skills from instructional environments to work environments). The core contribution of this research was the identification of behavioral markers associated with the antecedents of team performance and learning thus enabling the development and refinement of teamwork models in ITS architectures. Teamwork focuses on the coordination, cooperation, and communication among individuals to achieve a shared goal. For ITSs to optimally tailor team instruction, tutors must have key insights about both the team and the learners on that team. To aid the modeling of teams, we examined the literature to evaluate the relationship of teamwork behaviors (e.g., communication, cooperation, coordination, cognition, leadership/coaching, and conflict) with team outcomes (learning, performance, satisfaction, and viability) as part of a large-scale meta-analysis of the ITS, team training, and team performance literature. While ITSs have been used infrequently to instruct teams, the goal of this meta-analysis make team tutoring more ubiquitous by: identifying significant relationships between team behaviors and effective performance and learning outcomes; developing instructional guidelines for team tutoring based on these relationships; and applying these team tutoring guidelines to the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open source architecture for authoring, delivering, managing, and evaluating adaptive instructional tools and methods. In doing this, we have designed a domain-independent framework for the adaptive instruction of teams. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to examine the association between the use of three types of controls (input, behaviour and output) with the level of employee organisational commitment (EOC) across organisational life cycle (OLC) stages. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected by a survey questionnaire from a random sample of 343 general managers in Australian manufacturing business units. Findings – The level of EOC was found to be highest in growth and revival stage units, suggesting that EOC relates to the level of innovation. The analysis revealed that the types of controls were significantly associated with the level of EOC. In particular, a significant positive association was found between input controls and the level of EOC in both the birth and revival stages. Originality/value – This study contributes to both the management control system (MCS) literature and practice. First, because only a limited number of studies have examined the effect of MCSs on the level of EOC, and there is no published study to date which has examined the association between the types of controls with the level of EOC from an OLC perspective, this study fills a gap in the literature by examining these associations. Secondly, the findings have important implications for Australian manufacturing organisations. Specifically, by providing an insight into the association between the types of controls with the level of EOC across OLC stages, the results suggest that managers of organisations in the birth and revival stage need to place greater emphasis on input controls so as to enhance the level of EOC. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

There are no obvious reasons why ongoing investment in existing buildings should decline and the potential for increasing environmental sustainability by improving energy performance in the building stock remains considerable.

Each chapter starts with the perspective of a certain strategy problem, such as competition, but continues with an explanation of the strategy process using management science tools such as simulation. Facilitating the process of strategic decision making through the lens of management science, the author integrates topics that are usually in conflict for MBAs: strategy and quantitative methods. Strategic Analytics features multiple international real-life case studies and examples, business issues for further research and theory review questions and exercises at the end of each chapter. Strategic Analytics starts by introducing readers to strategic management. It then goes on to cover: managerial capabilities for a complex world; politics, economy, society, technology, and environment; external environments known as exogenous factors (PESTE) and endogenous factors (industry); industry dynamics; industry evolution; competitive advantage; dynamic resource management; organisational design; performance measurement system; the life cycle of organisations from start-ups; maturity for maintaining profitability and growth; and finally, regeneration. Developed from the author’s own Strategy Analytics course at Warwick Business School, personal experience as consultant, and in consultation with other leading scholars Uses management science to facilitate the process of strategic decision making Chapters structured with chapter objectives, summaries, short case studies, tables, student exercises, references and management science models Accompanied by a supporting website Aimed at both academics and practitioners, Strategic Analytics is an ideal text for postgraduates and advanced undergraduate students of business and management. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This practice of outsourcing aspects of the information system transforms the control structure of the outsourcing company and creates new challenges for management and accountants that are not explicitly addressed by current research. In this paper we synthesize academic literature and regulatory guidance on using third parties to perform functions with financial reporting implications (i.e., service organizations) and identify specific opportunities for future accounting research. To provide structure to our review and highlight knowledge gaps, we develop an organizing framework that links existing theories of outsourcing determinants to outsourcing risks and identifies the advantages and limitations of certain control mechanisms to mitigate such risks. Very little academic research exists on the use of service organizations,despite the rapid growth of this practice and regulators’ concerns that financial reporting quality may suffer due to inappropriate management oversight and audit deficiencies. We provide insights for future research on (1) factors influencing companies’ decisions to outsource the information system, (2) risks that arise when companies outsource the information system, and (3) implications for management control systems. © 2015, American Accounting Association.

The extent to which managers and policy makers currently have adequately come to terms with such complexity still remains open to discussion. The wicked problem construct (WPC) is a concept, process and a framework that can be used in identifying the reasons for these tensions and contradictions, explaining how they can be managed, and pointing out the limits they create for what is needed for effective organisational leadership. This paper examines the conceptual literature on 'wicked problems', identifying the critical dimensions of the proposed construct, and exploring the lack of attention to nonlinear epistemology of practice and systems thinking by managers and policy makers. The challenges of traditional management approaches to address complexity and to increase effectiveness in dealing with wicked problems are explained. The implication for practice of the WPC as a framework for organisational effectiveness in public, private, and the third sectors is described. Copyright © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We merged cross-sectional survey data on attitudes, from 156 primary physicians, with prospective medical record-sourced data on guideline adherence and census data on ambulatory-care population characteristics. We examined moderating effects by testing theory-driven models for satisfied versus discontented physicians, using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results show that attitudes motivated, while norms suppressed, adherence to guidelines among discontented physicians. Separate models for satisfied versus discontented physicians revealed motivational differences. Satisfied physicians disregarded intrinsic and extrinsic influences and biases. Discontented physicians, alienated by social pressure, favored personal inclinations. To improve adherence to guidelines among discontented physicians, incentives should align with personal attitudes and incorporate promotional campaigns countering resentment of peer and organizational pressure. © SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {Purpose: For team leaders or supervisors (functional coordinators (FCs)) warehouses are one of the most difficult places to supervise and manage subordinate workers. FCs themselves can be supervised by their bosses in different ways, either semi-autonomously or in a traditional authoritarian manner. However, different supervision environments for FCs may affect the performance of the warehouses they work in. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the linkages between different supervision environments; FCs' trust in and satisfaction with their bosses, warehouse service quality and company growth. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modelling (path analysis) is applied to a randomly drawn data sample (n=95) of dairy warehouses from the UK. Findings: The results show that semi-autonomous supervision has a strong positive impact on FCs' trust and satisfaction and on warehouse service quality which positively affects company growth. In addition, FCs' trust and satisfaction are found to be important antecedents of warehouse service quality and they also directly enhance company growth. In contrast, traditional supervision does not build trust nor creates satisfaction and has a negative direct impact on warehouse service quality. Research limitations/implications: While conducted based on a small sample, the study examines important performance determinants and thus enhances the understanding of how to better manage warehouses in particular in a logistically challenging industry. Originality/value: This study empirically analyses the linkages between supervision environments, warehouse service quality and company growth and thus contributes to determine a best-practice approach for modern warehouse management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Using Ward's hierarchical clustering algorithm we identified four distinct bundles of FWAs based on the uptake of twelve individual FWAs across the sample of organizations. Bundle 1 represents organizations engaging in a high level of annual hours contracts; bundle 2 represents more traditional work practices; bundle 3 represents organizations mainly offering shift-work and bundle 4 represents organizations with a high uptake of flexi-time. The demographic profile of organizations recorded across each of the four bundles was significantly different. Finally, significant associations were found between the bundle membership and employee turnover (p < 0.001), absenteeism (p < 0.001) and productivity (p < 0.015).

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a survey of 120 middle-level managers of Australian service organisations. Findings: The findings reveal that both the consideration and initiating leadership styles were associated with the diagnostic approach to using controls, while the initiating style was also associated with the interactive approach to using controls. In addition, the diagnostic approach to using controls was found to be associated with both organisational performance and EOC. The authors conclude that the diagnostic approach to using controls mediates the association between both the consideration and initiating styles of leadership with organisational performance and EOC. Practical implications: The findings provide practitioners with an important initial insight into the role of leaders in enhancing the achievement of organisational outcomes. From a practical perspective, organisations should consider these findings when recruiting. Specifically, organisations should work towards ensuring that their top-level managers possess such personal leadership traits. This could be achieved either through installing appropriate recruitment procedures and/or through the implementation of management training programmes.

Integrating the diverse literature related to the mechanisms that mediate the TFL-performance relationship, the current study identified five core mechanisms—affective, motivational, identification, social exchange, and justice enhancement—that are consistent with established social and psychological theories. Meta-analysis involving > 600 samples was conducted to test these mechanisms. General support was found for each of the five mechanisms. The findings showed that TFL was related to variables that represented these mechanisms, which in turn were associated with non-self-report measures of employees' task performance, citizenship behavior, and innovative behavior. An integrative model was further proposed and tested to show the central role of leader-member exchange in the relationships between TFL, other mediating variables, and performance outcomes. This study contributes to the literature by strengthening researchers' theoretical understanding of the major social and psychological processes by which transformational leaders promote followers' job performance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

A systemic literature review was performed using a structured process known as Knowledge Development Process-Constructivist (ProKnow-C), which leads to four steps: (i) relevant article selection for the portfolio, (ii) bibliometric analysis, (iii) systemic analysis, and (iv) research question definition of future research. This process enables researchers to build knowledge on the subject, showing several gaps in the current literature and instigating new works. Its importance lies in the framework available for future research about R & D and in the legitimation of the systemic literature review process as a knowledge generator. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This chapter addresses changes in teacher professionalism following contemporary education policy developments. A number of countries have introduced a relatively new set of public management approaches in education that emphasize the combined power of performance measurement, quality indicators, goal setting, incentives, accountability, and marketization to mobilize teachers’ work effort and raise student achievement. The chapter explores empirical studies that address changes in teacher work and teacher education, suggesting that this body of research can supply important insight into the dynamics of contemporary educational policy expectations towards teacher professionalism. It argues that issues surrounding teachers’ knowledge base and the different educational programmes leading into teaching should be seen in relation to that of increased external control of professional work. The ways in which teachers are educated to work in more knowledge-intensive societies could also be more closely investigated to enhance knowledge about what characterizes teachers’ work, education, and professionalism in new work contexts. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Mike Dent, Ivy Lynn Bourgeault, Jean-Louis Denis and Ellen Kuhlmann.},

New workplaces emerge where IT becomes more and more divergent, embedded and pervasive. These new aspects of IT at work need to be addressed with new or adapted human centred activities. This paper present and discuss a modified version of personas called contextual personas developed to better address the new working life. The contextual personas were developed using contextual inquiry, and focus groups as well as argumentative design. From the process of developing the contextual personas we learned that they are indeed a promising tool to understand the new work situations, and especially the holistic view of IT at work as they bring the whole working-life of the personas into focus. Finally, we discuss in what way the contextual personas could give developers extended understanding of the users’ future office work environment. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

By means of a survey administered to more than 300 faculty from 20 academic programmes undergoing quality assessments, we studied perceptions of the reasons behind the assessments. The results of our analysis show that faculty participation in the assessment process significantly decreases the chances that faculty believe quality assessments are carried out for instrumental reasons. In addition, those who believe assessments are carried out for quality improvement reasons are more likely to rate the assessments as legitimate and to be more identified with the academic programme that is being assessed. This study emphasizes the significance of faculty attributions about quality assessments and shows that faculty participation is crucial in overcoming initial scepticism towards external interventions. © 2013 Copyright Society for Research into Higher Education.},

This study benchmarks reason for the success or failure of construction projects from the cultural perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a case study approach, using the qualitative research method. Data were collected through participant observation and project records as part of the lessons learned and the data were analysed using the coding procedure of grounded theory. Re-confirmation and cross-checking interviews were also conducted to confirm the correctness of the coding. The qualitative data were expressed in quantitative terms to signify statistically the effect of the national culture on the construction project. In this way, the research methodology employed triangulation in its data analysis. Findings: This study found differences in the national culture of the Chinese construction project management teams in overseas construction projects in the UAE. The level of uncertainty and long-term orientation contributed to the success of one of the construction projects under scrutiny and the failure of the other. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to two construction projects in the UAE. Further research into construction projects is required to validate whether the national culture is generally an element to consider in overseas construction projects. Practical implications: The research study provides reasons for the success and failure of the two projects from the perspective of differences in national culture. Understanding the cultural differences in international construction projects should help to resolve project issues before these need to be terminated. The termination of a project has economic and social implications for all the stakeholders. Originality/value: No research study was found to have identified the national culture dimensions of overseas construction project management teams in the UAE. The longitudinal study helped to understand cultural assimilation during the execution of construction projects in the UAE. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Measuring knowledge of an organization as a unit allows for, in addition to other things, benchmarking it against other organizations as well as comparing the development within the organization in the course of time. Additionally, measuring the knowledge of individuals and groups helps identify key workers and can also be used when recruiting a new work force, while evaluating employees' work performances, or to check the course of the adaptation of a new employee. Even though the field of measuring knowledge belongs, in comparison with other topics, among the lesser-developed fields in the management of knowledge, a number of approaches that can be used to measure knowledge have been introduced. The aim of this study is to present an overview of methods which can be applied when measuring the knowledge of organizations, groups or individuals and thus provide a practical list of methods which feature in literature mostly for practitioners and novices in this field.

Industrial and organizational psychologists study teams in the industry settings for which we prepare students, yet this research does not effectively inform engineering education. Purpose: This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Scope/Method: Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. Conclusions: Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context. They sought to avoid social loafing and conflict while building trust to ensure equal team effort. That few Phase 1 articles engaged the literature about team effectiveness indicates there is great opportunity to apply industrial and organizational psychology research to engineering education. © 2013 ASEE.},

	abstract = {To explore the relationship between sustainability strategies and future energy needs, supply chains need to reduce their CO2 emissions through developing their green credentials and improving performance. Knowledge management (KM) is an enabler to support collaboration efforts. The SCM and KM areas have largely focused on improving organisational performance. While the latter has yielded successful outcomes in different sectors, there is still a scarcity of research on identifying influential factors highlighting those aspects which may enable green supply chain collaboration (GrSCC), thus leading to sustainable energy futures and carbon-efficient production. This paper examines the role of KM in facilitating GrSCC. Through the identification of key factors extrapolated from the literature, a model for implementing GrSCC using a futures-based perspective is proposed. This paper inductively demonstrates the relationship between identified GrSCC factors through fuzzy cognitive mapping technique. Findings support a futures-based perspective that enhances understanding and refines forward-looking strategies for GrSCC. © 2017 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The moment of truth—that instant when consumers experience and judge service quality—is often a deciding factor in business success. Designing Service Excellence: People and Technology provides practical information on the design, management, and organization of many different types of service industries, such as hotels, restaurants, banks and financial institutions, retail, and the public sector. The authors investigate the consumers’ experience and judgment on service quality, which ultimately determines the success or failure of the service. They then consider people, usability, and technology in the automation of high-quality service. This research-driven book identifies service—in a variety of forms—as an area of business and management where rapid change is taking place. The authors examine how service has become a balance between people and technology and explore this relationship as one of the key drivers of change. They discuss how social, cultural, and technological developments influence the ways in which customers contact, negotiate, and purchase services from their chosen service providers. These same developments are also driving communications between customers relating to the services they buy and are willing to recommend to others (or otherwise). Intermingled, these features of our current-day lives have changed the nature of service provision and service use. When your organization has its moment of truth, how will it measure up? Organizations whose business has service at its core and whose activities focus mainly on service design, management, and delivery are likely to find increasingly that, for survival, service is a matter of life or death. This book provides a deep understanding of the relationship between people and technology along with an ergonomic approach to the design and management of service delivery that helps you deliver the value and benefits that customers not only want, but increasingly come to expect. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The study is developed using the Italian context, which represents a well-known welfare-state model, and includes a sample of 107 organisations divided nearly equally among the for-profit, non-profit and public sectors. The study's results suggest that there is sector-specific heterogeneity in terms of both motivations for implementing WFB and the types of arrangements provided. Indeed, the various institutional contexts that characterise sectors significantly influenced the WFB arrangements implemented at the organisational level. In addition, the various cultural settings and attitudes of the three sectors determined various behaviour patterns. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: Keynote speech (review of the literature). Findings: This paper argues that the overlap between health and personnel economics is a new, fruitful area of research that can fill this void. Recent research in health economics has taught us that the life cycle perspective is key, and accordingly, the importance of childhood conditions have become increasingly better understood. However, the determinants of adult health, and the role of work life and working conditions and changes therein, are less well understood. Originality/value: The paper discusses what economists can contribute to this area of research, and then selectively reviews some previous studies, including an investigation of the relationship between job design and health in Europe. Finally, some thoughts are given regarding promising areas for further research and a brief discussion of the major challenges involved. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Using systematic review, 140 articles were identified on HPWPs and cross-cultural human resource management. Synthesizing the two literature areas results in four key findings. Many HR practices labelled as HPWPs are affected by national cultural dimensions. Also, several practices labelled as HPWPs have not been a part of the cross-cultural HR literature, and that limited studies in both area focus on the impact of cultural compatibility on outcomes. Finally, a few selected cultural dimensions have dominated the cross-cultural HR literature. Thus, more work is needed to: understand the role of national culture on effectiveness of HPWPs; increase coverage of HPWPs in the cross-cultural HR literature; understand the impact of cultural compatibility of HR practices and HPWPs on outcomes; and, incorporate additional cultural dimensions in future work. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

By constructing mixed-effects models from a large mid-1990s survey of U.S. steel employees, I find that team membership is linked to increased stress only when implemented in cultural contexts of conflict and distrust.

We can particularly benefit from incorporating accounting concepts to address some of the key BPM challenges, such as value-creation and return on investment of BPM activities. However, research which addresses a relationship between BPM and accounting is scarce. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed synthesis of the current literature that has integrated accounting aspects with BPM. The authors profile and thematically describe existing research, and derive evidence-based directions to guide future research. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-staged structured literature review approach to search for the two broad themes, accounting and BPM, supported by NVivo (to manage the papers and the coding and analysis processes) was designed and followed. Findings: The paper confirms the dearth of work that ties the two disciplines, despite the synergetic multidisciplinary results that can be attained. Available literature is mostly from the management accounting perspective and relates to describing how performance management, in particular performance measurement, can be applicable to process improvement initiatives together with tools such as activity-based costing and the balanced scorecard. There is a lack of research that examines BPM in relation to any financial accounting perspectives (such as external reporting). Future research directions are proposed together with implications for practitioners with the findings of this structured literature review. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a detailed synthesis of the existing literature on the nexus between accounting and BPM. It summarizes the implications for practitioners and provides directions for future research by identifying key gaps and opportunities with a sound contextual basis for extension and new work. Originality/value: Effective literature reviews create strong foundations for future research and accumulate the otherwise scattered knowledge into a single place.

Yet, research to date is mute on how or to what extent differences across boomerang employees' career experiences, and the learning and knowledge developed at and away from boomerang organizations, meaningfully impact their performance following their return. Addressing this omission, we extend a careers-based learning perspective to construct a theoretical framework of a parsimonious, yet generalizable, set of factors that influence boomerang employee return performance. Results based on a sample of boomerang employees and employers in the same industry (professional basketball) indicate that intraand extraorganizational knowledge construction and disruptions, as well as transition events, are significantly predictive of boomerangs' return performance. Comparisons with 2 matched samples of nonboomerang employees likewise suggest distinctive patterns in the performance of boomerang employees. © 2017 American Psychological Association.},

The comparison revealed significant improvement in employees affective commitment level using systems thinking design to create an organic structure when contrasted with employees working under mechanistic structure design. Further, systems thinking has been found of particular benefit to the service performance in terms of departmental communication enhancement and service waste minimisation. The value of this paper is the identification of alternative service design models applied to call centre operations that will leverage employees' affective commitment to improve service performance and enhance customer loyalty. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces a typology of “email overload” that distinguishes between information overload, work overload, and social overload that better captures the diversity of experiences reported in the literature. Information overload occurs when the amount of information to be consumed and assimilated, particularly with respect to a particular task or decision, exceeds the individual’s information processing capacity. Work overload occurs when the volume of messages received and the time required to respond appropriately exceeds the hours available in the workday. Social overload occurs when a worker receives email messages from too many different people evoking too many distinct roles and social contexts, exceeding the recipient’s interaction capacity. The chapter discusses the implications of the typology for doing studies that will produce finer-grained analyses, leading to more fruitful recommendations for knowledge workers and their managers. It considers the implications of contemporary trends in technology use for user experiences of overload. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Cary Cooper.},

	abstract = {The introduction of a performance assessment model based upon the measurement of merit through explicit, standardized, and objective criteria of productivity has provoked significant changes in the academic profession within the public higher education in Portugal. Given that employment security was made contingent upon obtaining adequate positive scores and promotion upon achieving maximum scores, a new institutional culture framed by precariousness and competition seems to have emerged. Moreover, as a consequence of austerity and with it the freezing of the pay awards associated with a promotion, the positive effects of excellent performance have been suppressed, while punitive measures for inadequate performance have been maintained. Based on ongoing qualitative research consisting of analysis of union position statements, interviews with union representatives, and interviews with academic staff of a Portuguese higher education institution, this article advances the hypothesis that evolution has taken place from resistance to routinization and acceptance of assessment procedures. © 2018, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.

Given research site observation, improving HRM practices fostering OC, IJP and OP was essential to high service quality in hospitality industry. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a survey based on interview and e-mail from 440 employees working at travel agencies in both countries. Analysis methodology included demographic statistics, descriptive statistics, factor analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. Findings: Only reward (RE), teamwork (TW), job description (JD), delegation (DL) and career management (CM) influenced affective commitment (AC); JD and CM affected continuance commitment (CC); and recruitment and selection (RS), RE, salary and wage (SW), TW, DL, job security (JS) and CM influenced normative commitment (NC) significantly and positively. Likewise, only RS, TR, SW, TW, DL and CM affected IJP; and TR, JS and CM affected OP significantly and positively. Finally, AC, CC and NC influenced IJP and only AC and CC impacted OP significantly and positively. Research limitations/implications: Sample and number of respondents were limited. Generalization of findings was not possible. E-mail respondents raised the problem of who filled the form. Scales did not include personality traits, socio-cultural features and economic conditions which should be explored. However, the research provided recommendations to travel agencies in both countries. Originality/value: This study filled the gap in hospitality industry in Iran and Turkey where research works into wide-ranging HRM practices–OC–IJP–OP links were few and far between. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Surprisingly little is known about the relationship between perceived work success and information behavior. This study shows that holistic (versus organization-centric) information behavioral preferences are related to interaction and exchange oriented perceptions of the success of work. The findings were drawn from a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) based analysis of the survey data (N = 305) collected from employees of a large multinational corporation. The findings suggest that holistic information behavior is more strongly related to social measures of success, whereas their association with quantitative measures tends to be lower. From the perspective of information behavior research, the findings suggest that holism seems to be a similar factor to, for instance, task complexity or personality, which influences human information behavior and, for instance, perceptions of relevance. From a practical perspective, the study suggests that the promotion of specific facets of measuring success and patterns of information behavior can be used to influence the orientation of working between centrifugality and openness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

To have a better understanding of OL, it is thus critical to explore how an organization may be transitioned into an LO and how its OL process is initiated, driven, enabled, facilitated and measured.

Moreover, how to measure trust is inherently difficult. By operationalising a trust framework that includes system-based, cognition-based and affect-based trust, a trust inventory is proposed. The reliability and stability of the inventory were then validated through the test-retest methodology. The proposed trust inventory can be used to assess trust pattern akin to the assessment of conflict handling style and the measurement of depression through the use of the Rahim's Organisational Conflict Inventory and the Inventory of Measuring Depression respectively. Supporting view on the appropriateness of the trust framework and the potential uses of the trust inventory were confirmed with two senior construction professionals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

A separate body of work generated by behaviourists illustrates how organizational culture is a major determinate in the effectiveness of the technology. Ultimately, corporate executives measure success in terms recognizable to financial markets. Yet, an empirical link connecting the interrelated dots needed to provide practical guidance to practitioners and executives remains elusive.

	abstract = {Information-centric wireless sensor networks' test bed is of vital significance. As a novel communication model, it can effectively test and reliably assess different algorithms, protocols, and applications of wireless sensor networks before deployment. Furthermore, detecting problems, ensuring stable operations, and reducing maintenance costs can also be attained. It is a promising architecture. Through the tests of the platform, new ideas are provided for the development of wireless sensor networks of the Internet of Things (IoT) and for the improvement of the performances of the IoT. An information-centric network is a promising branch of future Internet architecture, and its naming, naming routing, and intra-network caching are also suitable for wireless sensor networks. Recently, with the integration of such different key technologies as micro-sensor, communication, and simulation, test beds are becoming increasingly heterogeneous and complicated in large scale. Because of this, it is essential to know how to build a functional test bed by using the state-of-the-art infrastructure and technologies needed, so that there will be easier access to using and obtaining accurate testing results. In this paper, first, we summarize three aspects of the heterogeneous information-centric wireless sensor networks' test bed, including its requirements, testing technologies, and performance evaluation; second, we describe the heterogeneity of the test bed from three perspectives, including hardware resources, software resources, and communication technologies; third, we analyze the composition and implementation of each recent representative heterogeneous test bed in detail and the adequate compactness and the satisfactions of the requirements with each other; finally, we point out the open research issues on heterogeneous test bed.

In the information systems (IS) context, Melone suggested that users’ attitudes refer to “a predisposition to respond favorably or unfavorably to a computer system, application, system staff member, or a process related to the use of that system or application” and proposed that attitudes toward a certain behavior are affected by complex beliefs and intentions of the users. Some studies explored the relationship between public service performance and citizen trust in government. With the emergence of e-government, scholars began exploring the link between e-government performance and citizen trust where high-quality e-government services and online service transactions were expected to have positive impact on the level of citizen trust in government. © 2017 Taylor and Francis.},

Furthermore, the study examines the influence of such work-related attitudes on academic performance in respect to research, teaching and community service. Data were collected from a mail survey distributed to accounting academics within Australian universities. The results indicate that all four dimensions of the quality of the performance appraisal system were associated with work-related attitudes. Specifically, communication, fairness and clarity were positively associated with the level of EOC, trust was negatively associated with job-related stress and fairness was positively associated with the propensity to remain. With respect to the effect on academic performance, job-related stress was found to be negatively associated with research performance, while the level of EOC was positively associated with both teaching and community service.

	abstract = {Prior accounting studies on relative performance information (RPI) have mainly considered the effects of RPI on employees' performance. This study extends this stream of research by investigating relational effects of RPI that capture RPI recipients' attitudes towards RPI provision. Specifically, we examine the conditions under which RPI has a positive influence on perceived organizational support (POS). This is important because research on organizational behaviour has demonstrated that POS is an antecedent of desirable job-related attitudes such as organizational commitment, job involvement, and extra-role performance. The results of a dyadic survey in a hospital setting suggest that the effect of RPI on POS is conditional not only on the perceived usefulness of information and relative performance but also on the professional identification of RPI recipients. Our findings indicate that RPI provision is especially suitable for employees who possess a stronger social identification with their peer groups. Our study adds a relational perspective to the hitherto mostly informational and motivational focus in studying social comparison mechanisms linked to RPI systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a thorough literature search concerning the success and failure of lean implementations and acts as a precursor for one of the authors utilising a combination of methodologies; namely, interviewing, survey questionnaire and participant observation in attempting to prove his PhD hypothesis. Findings - Evidently, a cocktail of factors are needed for lean success; not only is it necessary to implement most of the technical tools but an organisation's culture needs transforming too. Furthermore, the alterations need to be implemented throughout an organisation's value chain. Lean has a major strategic significance, though its implementation procedure, HRM implications, general approach to the supplier base coupled with the overall universal conviction of viewing lean as a set of tactics rather than embracing it as a philosophy advocates that this contributes to the relatively low number of successful lean initiatives. Originality/value - The paper would prove invaluable to lean practitioners through its summation of the intricacies towards lean enterprise success and academic researchers by focusing their attention towards the necessary cultural implications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

After analyzing the board’s role and the individual board member’s role within a nonprofit organization, the paper explores the limits to decision-making within governing bodies. The paper shows why a unitary board can improve the quality of decision-making within nonprofit organizations by raising the incentives for the executive director to act as desired.

This has enabled a number of studies with an emphasis on the relationship between software product size, effort and cost drivers in order to either measure the average performance for similar software projects or to develop estimation models and then refine them using the collected data. However, despite these efforts, none of those methods are yet deemed to be universally applicable and there is still no agreement on which cost drivers are significant in the estimation process. This study discusses some of the possible reasons why in software engineering, practitioners and researchers have not yet been able to come up with reasonable and well quantified relationships between effort and cost drivers although considerable amounts of data on software projects have been collected.

	abstract = {Minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) is a common figure of merit for assessing the performance of thermal imagers, because it represents the thermal sensitivity and spatial resolution. The work in this paper focuses on the design of an instrument that can provide the performance parameter MRTD for the measurement. The instrument under our research, adopted a new work principle based on the theory of Heat Transfer, appears more miniaturized and more portable, which makes the impractical fieldwork possible. In this paper, the new method that enables the high accuracy plane radiation source in the instrument is presented in detail. By means of the theory of heat transfer, the finite elements analysis (FEA) method and the MATLAB software, the analysis and simulation of temperature-field of the plane radiation source is carried out. Subsequently, the geometrical parameter of the instrument architecture is optimized and the model instrument is manufactured. Finally, the experiment with the model is implemented and the data of the temperature-field is collected. The predictions of the theoretical results are found to agree well with the experimental data. Moreover, the uniformity and stability of temperature-field can meet the requirements of the inspection for the thermal imaging system.},

In a nine-hospital study of patient care, we identify high-performance work practices that positively predict the strength of relational coordination among doctors, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, and case managers, in turn predicting quality and efficiency outcomes for their patients. Relational coordination mediates the association between these high-performance work practices and outcomes, suggesting a relational pathway through which high-performance work systems work. © 2010 INFORMS.},

She aims to show how some concepts from literacy studies, in particular the relationship between literacy practices and literacy events, can fruitfully be brought together with ideas about the temporal dimensions of the local and the global to uncover how policy is instantiated in classroom practice and how the ILP mediates power and control. She argues that by sanctioning some definitions of literacy and learning whilst excluding others, ILPs construct the identities of teachers and learners by specifying desirable abilities. She suggests that discussion of the nature of ILPs and of their function within systems of performance measurement should become part of the explicit content of literacy education.},

The findings showed that structural factors such as moderate level of demographic diversity, proximity of team members, team longevity, and contextual factors (procedural and interactional justices) were positively related to the development of interpersonal trust in NPD teams. The findings also revealed that interpersonal trust had an impact on team learning and new product success, but not on speed-to-market. Further, the findings showed that the impact of interpersonal trust on team learning and new product success was higher when there was higher task complexity.

The present study investigates perceived success and how it is related to corporate finance professionals' information source use behavior based on a Web survey of 92 Finnish corporate finance professionals. The principal finding of the statistical analysis of the data is that perceptions of work success and specific types of information sources contributing to the success are related. The correlations are complex, and very different types of information sources contribute to individual types of success, and vice versa. The findings indicate that information sources function as measures of success and serve an instrumental purpose. Besides functional relations, the correlation of the variables suggests more comprehensive success and information source use related dependencies and preferences. The findings imply that by studying existing perceptions of success, it is possible to make inferences about preferred information sources. The study also suggests that both personal and organizational perceptions of success should be taken into account when planning information services and information literacy education for corporate finance professionals to increase their effectiveness and relevance for the professionals. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

Design/methodology/ approach - The paper combines a theory building/theory testing approach. Based on literary findings a conceptual model has been postulated to identify constructs associated with upstream performance measurement and lead benchmarking. A selection of research questions are posed and tested via empirical study. The survey instrument was distributed to 800 UK organisations which resulted in 157 responses. Findings - Results from the empirical research indicate that new lead, forward looking, predictive benchmarks need to be developed to support lead benchmarking and performance measurement activities. Furthermore, it was found that currently larger organisations are more likely to adopt these practices, with considerable variation across organisational sectors. Research limitations/implications - The empirical research achieved a 19.6 per cent response rate. While this is adequate to report statistical representation, further data collection would be beneficial for industry generalisations. Practical implications - Many organisations struggle to grasp metric measurement for lead benchmarking. This paper may provide insight into key factors to be considered for lead benchmarking uptake. Originality/value - This paper builds on current literature and develops a conceptual model which is then tested via empirical research. This is a novel approach in the area of lead benchmarking. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In the light of these developments, this paper draws together the research on heads' responses to marketisation and suggests theoretical hypotheses on the impact of its underlying features on their psychological well-being. Our argument is that the major features of educational marketisation may promote the emergence of both the determinants of professional growth and self-renewal and of occupational stress and job burnout among headteachers. These determinants, in turn, lead to the appearance of two types of well-being among school heads. To support our hypothesis we refer to the work of others and empirical findings from various fields of study.},

It has also come to be regarded as a significant area of academic research over the past three decades. However, in that time research in strategy has largely migrated to a concern with strategy as that which organizations have, rather than strategy as that which managers do. In other words, the activity of managing and developing the strategy of organizations by the people concerned with actually doing it has become marginalized. Strategy as Practice reverses this trend by analysing what people do in relation to the development of strategy in organizations. In so doing it provides insights into current issues in strategy that require a more micro level of understanding. This pragmatic approach also helps to integrate different aspects of strategy research and provides insights that will help managers work more effectively.  © Gerry Johnson, Ann Langley, Leif Melin and Richard Whittington 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2010.},

This EKO viewpoint integrates many concepts and applications from various literatures, but it is somewhat contrary to the conventional wisdom that has tended to de-emphasize the significance of information technology in knowledge management.

Concepts such as knowledge work and human capital drive the shift in professional focus from ‘place’ to ‘workplace’. The responsibilities of facility managers extend beyond operating issues to the more fundamental goals of providing highperforming and sustainable workplaces. Accordingly, the performance measurement paradigm must also be shifted from measuring facilities to measuring workplaces, using models and measures that recognise the importance and interdependence of facilities, information technology and human resources. This paper discusses initial efforts to measure innovative workplaces, provides an example of an organisation committed to providing its customers with innovative workplaces, and concludes that the measurement of innovative workplaces itself requires innovative and ‘out of the box’ techniques. New measurement paradigms are critical, however, not for ‘proving’ the case for the implementation of these innovative workspace solutions, but for evaluating and comparing evolving workplace approaches already under way. © 2002, © MCB UP Limited.},

	abstract = {Quality, productivity and flexibility are vital factors in today's machining industry in order to remain competitive. Nowadays, finished products not only have to be produced within specific tolerance limits, but they also have to posses high standards in terms of surface integrity, i.e. physical and chemical properties of the surface and its vicinity. On the other hand, manufacturers must adapt at higher pace to changes in product specifications such as modified geometry, new work-material, higher requirements on the surface finish, or lower environmental impact throughout the cycle life of the product. Therefore, machining processes with enhanced flexibility are needed. Last but not least, the ability of a company in being profitable is closely related to its productivity, i.e. how efficient the recourses are used to create valuable products. In prior research there has been an extensive amount of work focused on specific topics described above. Nevertheless, it is often the case that an improvement in product quality has a bad impact on productivity, or improved productivity diminishes flexibility and vice versa. In this work, the effect new cutting technologies on product quality, flexibility and productivity have been investigated. The approach has been empirical and statistical methods have been used. The work is divided in three different topic areas. Firstly, the thesis explores the possibilities of high-pressure jet-assisted machining for turning difficult to cut materials, especially for those applications where existing tool geometries are not effective such as near net shaped products, unleaded alloys and stainless steels. It is shown that ultra high pressure cooling significantly improves chip formation and breakage, and thus productivity, as well as surface finish. Secondly, the relationship between residual stress, surface topography and cutting parameters in hard turning was investigated. It was found that residual stress are significantly influenced by cutting parameters which opens the possibility of manufacturing products with Taylor made stress profiles in order to enhance the fatigue life of the component during service. Hard turning can outperform grinding not only in terms of product quality, but also in flexibility and productivity. Third and last, new coating designs were investigated for dry machining applications. Dry machining is gaining industrial and academic interest since coolant costs are on the increase due to environmental concerns. Two coating concepts were studied: titanium-aluminium-nitride (TiAlN), which is a single phase solid solution material, and titanium-silicon-nitride (TiSiN), which is a nanocomposite structured material. Optimal coating composition and adhesion treatments are described in the thesis.},

Nevertheless, key to all these is the effective measurement of the IT/IS utilisation for existing process such that the underperforming areas are highlighted, and corrective actions are taken to achieve optimal use of IS/IT. There are a variety of performance measurement mechanisms available that stimulate improvement efforts, in so doing helping businesses to translate perceived business strategy into action. However, these approaches are mostly aimed at high level evaluation of an organisation's performance; whereas the stochastic nature and ever expanding scope of asset management processes demands asset managers to have a comprehensive view of asset lifecycle and the interacting business areas. This paper proposes an evaluation framework for IT/IS based asset management in an engineering enterprise. The paper firstly seeks to present a critique of the asset management paradigm. It then discusses available performance measurement mechanisms and develops a case for the constituents of an effective asset management measurement framework that provides detailed indicators for controls actions required to achieve optimal process efficiency through the use of IT/IS. The paper, then, presents an integrated asset performance measurement framework that not only is derived from business strategy, but informs strategy formulation through a closed loop learning encompassing entire asset management lifecycle.},

Nonprofit and public organizations are less likely to use performance incentives (gain sharing and bonuses) and some multiskilling practices than are for-profit organizations but more likely to use both self-directed work teams and offline committees. Sectoral differences in the prevalence of incentive compensation and self-directed teams persist after correlates of sector that predict HPWO prevalence - including establishment size, industry, computational requirements, and unionization - are controlled. © 2006 Sage Publications.},

It shows how ILPs, originally a means of formative assessment, have become part of a system of performance indicators and function as a key mediating mechanism between local interactions and system goals. The article draws on theoretical perspectives from the new literacy studies and the sociology of science to reveal the pivotal role of texts in projects of social ordering. The methodology is a version of institutional ethnography, whereby an artefact (the ILP) is tracked as it circulates across the different sites of its production and use. Documentary and interview evidence are used. The article concludes that, in its current form, the ILP shapes teaching and learning relationships and aligns both tutor and student identities. Permissive guidance, combined with a core curriculum, the demands of audit and inspection, positions tutors uncomfortably as active mediators between student experience and the policy discourse. © 2009 British Educational Research Association.},

Design/methodology/approach – This paper draws on a longitudinal case study initiated by the findings from a previous action research study at a manufacturing plant, the Volvo Floby factory. Findings – By introducing and elaborating on the concept of local management accounting system (LMAS), this paper contributes to the debate about how management accounting reacts to new organizational forms and technologies. Two types of management accounting information are identified: one corresponds to the accountability aspect of accounting – Type 1 information, while Type 2 information refers to problem solving and control. A LMAS is supportive of both local accountability, which draws on valuing skills, and of local problem solving, which relies on decision skills. Research limitations/implications – One of the research implications of this study is that a LMAS may function as an important mechanism for innovation by explicitly integrating the holistic and the analytic dimensions of experiential learning. Practical implications – The reported case illustrates how management accounting may facilitate process innovation in a practical setting. Originality/value – By adopting an experiential learning methodology to develop new knowledge, the production plant studied has succeeded in creating an environment characterized by continuous innovation. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {The Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) of Ross, and extensions of that theory, constitute an important branch of asset pricing theory and one of the primary alternatives to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). This chapter discusses the theoretical underpinnings, econometric testing, and applications of the APT. The APT is based on a simple and intuitive concept. Ross's basic insight was that a linear factor model of asset returns, in an economy with a large number of available assets, implies that idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable and that the equilibrium prices of securities will be approximately linear in their factor exposures. The chapter focuses on factor modeling of asset returns. The APT relies fundamentally on a factor model of asset returns. Theoretical derivations of the APT pricing restriction and the evidence from estimates and tests of the APT are also presented in the chapter. APT has led to new work in mathematical economics on infinite-dimensional vector spaces as models of maw-asset portfolio returns, and the properties of continuous pricing operators on these vector spaces. It has led to econometric insights about what constitutes a factor model, and how to efficiently estimate factor models with large cross-sectional data sets. It has underpinned an enormous body of empirical research on asset-pricing relationships, and on related topics such as performance measurement and cost of capital estimation. © 1995, Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Purpose - The primary purposes of this paper are to add support to the existing three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3DCE) theoretical framework and to identify issues that currently hinder the adoption of 3DCE. Design/methodology/approach - While 3DCE has been suggested as a way to improve new product development success and supply chain performance, the research on 3DCE is in its infancy, largely conceptual, or based on two, rather than all three aspects of 3DCE. To help bridge the gap between concept and theory for 3DCE, this paper provides a cross-disciplinary perspective, incorporating literature from supply chain management (SCM) and logistics, operations management, marketing channels, and general management and strategy, to help ground the theory of 3DCE. Based on this literature, testable research propositions are developed. Findings - Based on the review of the literature, there is substantial theoretical grounding for 3DCE and evidence that it should provide beneficial outcomes to organizations. 3DCE is also a very useful theoretical lens as researchers become more concerned with taking a systemic view of supply chain and organizational performance. Effectively using 3DCE as a lens may require different research approaches, such as systems dynamics and supply chain mapping. Practical implications - This research provides insights into the relatively low adoption rates of 3DCE in practice. Successful 3DCE requires top management support as well as functional support. It is not simply a SCM tool. Originality/value - From a research perspective, this paper helps provide support for using 3DCE as a theoretical lens for grounding future research. It also provides an insight into research methods that might be most useful in gaining greater understanding of 3DCE practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Many approaches are available, which exhibit various degrees of overlap, reinvention and claims of universal application. Given the resources involved, especially in regard to time and costs, there is a need to provide some form of guidance in choosing a business improvement methodology or combination of approaches. The aim of this paper is to review the effects of organisational size and sector on management choice of business improvement methodology. A multi-method approach is used in this research. Firstly, an empirical research methodology is used to survey 800 UK organisations, encompassing different sizes and sectors, in relation to their choice of business improvement methodology. The findings indicate that business improvement methodologies are not universal. Multiple case study analysis (still ongoing) was conducted within five large organisations. Reference is made to preliminary analysis carried out within one of the organisations under study. This case illustrates that executives will introduce business improvement methodologies based on the needs of the organisation, as well as facilitate the transfer of learning and knowledge from experts who are familiar with the application of these tools.},

The book is divided into three sections which explore three linked key aspects: • Part I focuses on the concept and nature of quality and accountability and the process of developing a culture of quality. • Part II addresses the issues of managing staff and resources, leadership for highquality teaching and learning, and relationships with stakeholders. • Part III considers the impact and prospect of quality and accountability, including internal evaluation and external inspection. The book will appeal to educational leaders and managers, advisors and inspectors, and academic researchers. It will also be of particular relevance to Masters and doctoral degree students specialising in school leadership and management. © 2011 Mark Brundrett and Christopher Rhodes.},

Using a sample of public employees in South Korea, this study finds that, contrary to conventional wisdom, employee trust is based on the trustee’s some stereotypic beliefs about the trustor and that trust and commitment at both the group and organizational level have stronger effects on innovative behavior than at the individual level. In particular, innovation is likely to be maximized when Korean public employees show a high level of trust in co-worker group, because of the group-based organizational culture in Korea. Findings suggest that managers need to create an affective atmosphere in which the relationship between the trustor and the trustee is tied with positive stereotypic beliefs to encourage innovation in an organization and that the trustees must go beyond the fairness issue in performance evaluation. © 2008 International Review of Public Administration.},

	abstract = {Given the prevailing emphasis on agency performance, customer focus, stakeholder's interests and other methods of assessment under new public administration and prevailing managerialism in many public sectors around the world, administrative practitioners have taken to benchmarking as an instrument for assessing organizational performance and for facilitating management transfer and learning from other benchmarked organizations. The introduction of benchmarking into the public sector is still in its early stages. Technical problems, scepticism about usefulness and the appropriateness of transferring putative private sector competencies into public administration and the resistance in accepting organizational change as a necessary consequence of benchmarking exercises in the public sector, prevent the widespread acceptance and use of benchmarking in public sectors, arguably "punch-drunk" with systemic change. Neverthekss, there are some encouraging examples of benchmarking within the public sector. This paper critically analyzes these examples in order to establish the vulnerability points of such measurement instruments which, possibly, need more research in order to establish the specific karning dimensions to benchmarking and to illustrate the importance of such benchmarking and learning within the highly risky, information technology (IT)-driven experiences of systems development and failure.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a timely review of developments to the theory of constraints (TOC) body of knowledge, particularly the TOC thinking processes as reported in the public domain peer-reviewed literature, and to present an analysis of the nature of the thinking processes (TPs), and their methodological and applicatory evolution. Design/methodology/approach - Research reported in the public domain from 1994 to early 2006, as peer-reviewed journal articles or as papers published in refereed conference proceedings, was reviewed to summarize key research issues that have been studied and to suggest future research. The literature is categorized along several dimensions and according to several emergent and self-defined clusters that relate to application area, methodology and epistemology. Findings - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the TP literature, identifies specific publication and research gaps as they relate to the defined classification and also provides some future research topics. Research limitations/implications - The review addresses only the peer-reviewed literature spanning a limited period from 1994 to the time of the current work in early 2006 - that is the period since the publication of Goldratt's It's Not Luck. In doing so, the review complements the work of others for the period to 2000, extends previous reviews beyond 2000, whilst providing an additional focus on the TPs. Practical implications - This paper provides useful insights about the development of the TOC body of knowledge, especially as it relates to the development and reported use of the TPs as stand-alone tools or in tandem with other tools or methods. It provides a valuable summary, for academics and practitioners, of the developing TOC body of knowledge that has been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Originality/value - The development of the TOC body of knowledge has been largely practice-led, manifested not only in the diverse nature of application areas and in the diverse use of TOC tools, but also in the broader evolution of TOC methodology, methods and tools. Earlier reviews of the literature in this journal preceded many of the developments documented here. This paper will help position the many TOC methods and tools in relation to one another, as well as capturing developments in multi-methodological usage across several domains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

These techniques are part of a process management system that includes the organizational infrastructure to support the improvement techniques. The knowledge-based view of a firm argues that organizational knowledge is the source of competitive advantage. To the extent that the process management system enables knowledge creation it should be a source of competitive advantage. This study investigates the underlying framework and factors of a process management system that lead to organizational knowledge creation. Prior studies have considered knowledge creation in process improvement, but none have considered the role of the process management system. Specifically, the study uses the case study method to investigate multiple levels (organization level and project level) of two firms using Six Sigma as their chosen process management system. Analysis of the cases reveals that the leadership creates a supportive infrastructure enabling process-improvement techniques to effectively create organizational knowledge. Interestingly, focusing on decision-making tools and methods may not be effective without developing a supportive infrastructure. The proposed framework provides a basis for organizational leaders to think about how to design and implement a process management system to better enable knowledge creation in organizations. © 2010 The Authors Decision Sciences Journal © 2010 Decision Sciences Institute.},

	abstract = {This thesis is based on the author's independent scientific thinking on the essence of building intelligence since 1988, for the purpose of establishing and arguing for the Building Intelligence Framework (BIF). Furthermore, it is based on the Intelligent Buildings (IBs) Survey of twelve office buildings in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The survey was done right after the first boom of construction of intelligent buildings was over in Finland. There is no universal definition for the intelligent building concept, although a certain consensus about the concept can be found. There is little empirical evidence about the feasibility of or the factors involved in any intelligent building and there is no description of the intelligence of buildings, or if using the concept of intelligence in the context of quality of a building is valid. Consequently, there is no evidence about such an intelligent building, which is defined by the BIF. In fact, at the beginning of the IBs Survey project not only the feasibility, but even the existence, of the intelligent building concept was questioned. The IBs Survey project was carried out at the Technical Research Centre of Finland VTT, Building Technology, in 1993 - 1997, in order to study the feasibility of the IB concept and its existence. After finished the IBs Survey project at VTT, the author of this thesis has continued the analysis of the data of the IBs Survey within scientific studies since 1996 and during the research work on this thesis she has gained a deeper understanding of the essence of the building intelligence, which has bothered her mind since the beginning of her studies on the IBs from 1988. The IBs Survey was a post-occupancy study on office building quality. The quality of the intelligent office buildings was compared to that of the other high quality office buildings. The hypothesis of the IBs Survey project was that the existence of the differences between the qualities of the intelligent and the other office buildings will prove the existence of the IB concept. The lack of the differences between the intelligent and the other office buildings will talk for the absence of any effect of the implementation of the IB concept. The IBs Survey project at VTT proved both some differences between and some similarities in the qualities of the IBs and the other office buildings. This thesis is a summary of the results of the scientific studies based on the IBs Survey data, and on the other hand this thesis is a monograph on the BIF. The scientific studies based on the IBs Survey data proves or disproves the existence and feasibility of the IB concept and the BIF determines the essence of the building intelligence. The final goal is a synthesis of the IBs Survey and the BIF. The different intelligent building concepts define the intelligent buildings, not the intelligence of the building. This thesis suggests a definition of building intelligence - called the Building Intelligence (BI) - on the premise that human intelligence can imprint intelligence into an inorganic object, such as a building. The implementation of the BI into intelligent buildings is shown by the BIF. The difference between the IB concepts and the BI is clarified. On one hand, the use of the IB concepts for technical purposes, and on the other hand, the scientific aims of the BI and its implementation into the building practise of the IBs - the BIF - is explained. The alternation of the tacit and explicit knowledge of the IB concept is shown to form the platform for the appearance of any building concept. The definition of the building intelligence (the BI) is an explicit articulation of the internal stock of knowledge of intelligent buildings. The purpose of the BI is to separate out the buildings built according to the IB concept from the buildings built according to other building concepts. The derivation of the IB from the IB concepts and human intelligence - the BIF - can be used as a starting point for the next phase or version of the definition of a building concept, which can be either intelligent or something new. The further the analysis of the empirical data on the IBs Survey proceeds the more evidence of the differences between office buildings, which have been designed using the intelligent building concept as a leading design criterion and the buildings, which have not been designed according to the IB concept criteria are found in terms of the efficacy of these office buildings. This difference is witnessed by the quality evaluation of the end product - i.e. that of the building itself. This quality evaluation is an end-user evaluation, which evaluates the importance of quality of the office building and that of its components to the working efficiency of the evaluator. This is how the evaluation result turns into the efficacy of the office building system, which is composed of its components, i.e. of its subsystems. The result supports the feasibility of the IB concept in office design. The evaluation results from the post-occupancy study correlate with the job description and gender of the office worker. In general, executives evaluate their working environment better than other occupancy groups. The opinions of professionals and clerical staff differ according to the building property concerned and according to the gender of the respondent. Important parameters of the intelligent office building design have been sought out from among a large number of parameters of the intelligent building concepts. This extrapolation is based on the empirical evidence from the results of the IBs Survey and the definition of the BIF, which highlights certain factors of the IB concepts. The existence of the IBs is dependent on the application of the IB concept factors during the building design process. It can be concluded, that the IB concept criteria will be fulfilled best, if the building design is based on more than one of the elements of the IB concept. Furthermore, the quality of the intelligent subsystems must not fail, if the target is a good intelligent working environment. The thesis closes with the synthesis of some of the results of the IBs Survey and the theory of the BIF. Finally, the IB elements should form a functional combination, an integrated solution. Simply adding high technology, is not enough. Embedding the building intelligence by merging it into the building is held up as the intelligent solution to the design of a successful intelligent workplace. Copyright © VTT 2003.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to use a social capital and learning organisation theoretical framework to clarify two issues: how female entrepreneurs manage interactions with employees and whether they learn about new business opportunities from workplace networks. The qualitative findings demonstrated that female entrepreneurs used a relational approach to manage their employees which social capital theory (SCT) predicts should have promoted a workplace environment-based on trust and reciprocity of ideas, information and resources. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained from semi-structured phone and person-to-person interviews. The qualitative questions sought to solicit information about how female entrepreneurs managed (particularly their staff) and whether they used workplace processes to be innovative and learn about new venture opportunities from within their firms. Findings - The paper provides support to previous research that argues female entrepreneurs traditionally use a relational approach to managing their businesses. However, in contrast to previous literature about SCT, this paper found that only about a quarter of the female entrepreneurs used a social capital approach to learn about potential venture opportunities from their staff. Hence, the findings suggest that these female entrepreneurs did not engage in active learning from employees. Research limitations/implications - This study's findings have a number of limitations. Firstly, the sampling process could have caused bias in the data collection and therefore the generalisability of the findings may be compromised. Moreover, the sample size is limited; hence further research is necessary across numerous countries to improve the generalisability of the exploratory study. Practical implications - The implication of these findings is that the majority of female entrepreneurs probably do not use workplace employee networks to provide new venture opportunities. Governments may need to consider strategies for supporting female entrepreneurs to capture new venture opportunities. Originality/value - Previous research suggests that small to medium-sized enterprises do not necessarily perceive networks outside of the firm as a source of new ideas and the findings from this study suggest than only a quarter of the female entrepreneurs attempted to learn from inside the firm. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The paper focuses on how library staff has perceived the introduction and how the library visitors look at it. The paper further elicits information about differences between library visitors using this service and visitors not using it. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the introduction of citizen services in two local libraries. It focuses on staff reactions and perceptions and it also analyses the use and perception of the service in relation to the traditional services. The paper is based on interviews with the involved library staff, citizen service users and administrative staff. The paper is also founded on a survey among library visitors in the two libraries. The survey was conducted as an on-line and a paper-based survey. Findings – The major findings of the paper are that the library staff as a whole welcome the new work tasks because they feel that it is of value for the local community. The findings also indicate that a feared conflict between service tasks and authority tasks did not pose a problem in reality. The library visitors as a whole also welcomed the citizen service in the local libraries and perceived it as a kind of service improvement. Nearly, 25 per cent of the users have used this service in the library and they appreciated it very much. However, the service does not rank high in the visitors' perception of significance of library services. It indicates that the library visitors appreciate new services that are convenient but also that it does not matter that much. The paper also indicates that it is frequent library visitors who use citizen services in library most. There is no indication of the new library users as an effect of the introduction of citizen services in the library. Research limitations/implications – The limitation is, of course, that the paper is based on a study of only two local branches and it would be scientifically problematic to generalise the results – at least in a statistical sense. Originality/value – The paper is based on a traditional evaluation study.

After an initial discussion of the notion "systems thinking" and "quality systems," this article suggests a model for the essential criteria for quality systems in schools. This model is then utilised to evaluate 3 widely accepted approaches to quality management within Australia for their applicability to the school situation - ISO 9001/4 2000, Investors in People and the Australian Business Excellence Framework. While it is suggested that all 3 approaches could have some relevance to quality systems development in schools, the unique culture of schools would present significant challenges to their utilisation.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Capitalist transformation of the public sector is global phenomenon that affects many countries. This paper seeks to examine recent public sector reforms introduced by the Government of Botswana to improve civil service performance. The underlying political philosophy behind the change in the public sector is explored by relating the neoliberal ideology which is driving the reform agenda to the discourse of new public management (NPM). Design/methodology/approach - A realist social theory is used to explain generative mechanisms and structures that are the driving force behind the change process. Findings - The paper suggests that the public sector provides essential services, which many poor people in the developing world depend on. Consequently, privatisation of public services is more likely to exacerbate poverty and to intensify inequality because the private sector is profit not needs centred. Moreover, these changes will have serious consequences for the workers. Already some have been retrenched and those remaining face a new work regime. Outsourcing is one facet of it in Botswana, which is associated with poor pay and bad working conditions. Practical implications - Provides a deeper understanding of restructuring of the public sector which is crucial for labour organisations and researchers on labour relations. Originality/value - Previous research on Botswana reforms has tended to promote neoliberal globalisation. This is the first paper that challenges comprehensively this dominant paradigm and its accompanying ideology of NPM by offering an alternative critique from a standpoint of the poor and exploited. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {During the past two decades a variety of reforms and projects under the mantle of public-sector modernization were developed in order to achieve efficiency, effectiveness, economy and quality in service delivery. Despite the overwhelming consensus that public organizations must transform there is little evidence on how to pursue modernization successfully. This paper argues that modernization is tantamount to creating a “learning public administration”. Managing the transformation process rests on the organization's capability to continuously enhance, the collective capacity to reflect, to learn how to learn, to unlearn old ways of doing things and abandon old habits. How to best navigate the transition from a rigid and conventional mode of thinking towards a creative and strategic one remains the challenge in the current knowledge-based economy. As a response to this challenge the present paper presents the management, training and evaluation (MATE) model – a knowledge management strategic technique – that can be utilized for modernizing government organizations. Based on the results of a pilot case study undertaken within the context of Greek public sector we argue that modernization's success depends on how knowledgable an organization is in the strategic running of three core systems: the management (MA) system, the training (T) system and the evaluation (E) system. More specifically, the case study has shown that the exercise of the range of activities included in the three MATE systems may serve as the practical field, as the ideal setting for developing inquiry skills, “double-loop” learning capabilities at individual and organizational level. © 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the internal branding process from the perspective of service providers in Thailand. It will reveal the key internal branding mechanisms and empirically assess the relationship between internal branding and employees' brand attitudes and performance. Design/methodology/approach - A case study representing the Thai hotel industry is adopted with mixed methodologies. In-depth interviews are first carried out with 30 customer-interface employees in six major hotels in Thailand. On a census basis, a quantitative survey with 699 respondents from five major hotels in Thailand follows. Findings - Internal branding coordinating marketing with human resource management has a statistically significant impact on attitudinal and behavioural aspects of employees in their delivery of the brand promise. As employees' brand commitment do not have a statistically significant relationship with employees' brand performance, it is not regarded as a mediator in the link between internal branding and employees' brand performance. Practical implications - A number of significant managerial implications are drawn from this study, for example using both internal communication and training to influence employees' brand-supporting attitudes and behaviours. Still, it should be noted that the effect of internal branding on employee behaviours could be dependent on the extent to which it influences their brand attitudes. Originality/value - The paper provides valuable insights, from the key internal audience's perspectives, into an internal branding process. It has empirically shown the relationship between internal branding and the behavioural outcome as well as the partial meditating effects of employees' brand identification, commitment and loyalty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the recent emphasis on teams in the health services research literature tends to be attributed to our rising recognition that flexible and self-organizing teams are in the best position to handle the increasing complexity and fragmentation of health services. With a brief review of two papers on health-care teams as its point of departure, this paper argues that the concern with teams harbours a realization that the organizational-managerial point of gravity of most clinical work lies with those who do the work. In the context of health reforms sweeping across most countries in the industrialized world, this means that teams are to embody dynamic self-organization as do 'communities of practice (CoPs)', and be the origin of the managerial and documentary realities that describe, define and validate them. Following through on this last point, the paper reflects on some of the constitutive facets of teams as CoPs, and proposes that in the context of health reform such emergent teamness encompass participating, knowledging and boundary spanning. Fusing contextual, attributional and processual dimensions of team conduct, these notions are elaborated to show how descriptions of teamness can be rendered sensitive to the prerogatives of health reform. The paper concludes with outlining some of the implications of this proposal for how we reconceptualize health services management. © Health Services Management Centre 2005.},
