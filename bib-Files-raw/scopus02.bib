	abstract = {Taking the Transactive Memory System (TMS) perspective, this study aims to explore how social media usage in learning communities stimulates learning performance within teams when team knowledge sharing, team efficacy and team bonding embody the core elements in transactive communication processes. Data were collected from 64 student project teams in three waves using a time-lagged approach and team dynamics were examined across different stages of the project. Results were significantly positive for social media usage in learning communities, demonstrating varied impacts of TMS on team learning performance. Findings show that increase in social media usage facilitated team bonding, knowledge sharing and team efficacy within project teams. Interestingly, the results related to TMS had a positive impact on team learning performance only through team efficacy and team bonding, while knowledge sharing had no impact. These findings provide useful insights for educational practitioners and future employers about formulating strategies such that project teams can develop TMS needed to organize and execute actions required to effectively make social media usage decisions that influence team performance. This paper advances the TMS theory by highlighting the role of social media in enhancing team learning performance while working in project-based teams. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Acculturation is becoming an increasingly important and discussed topic in management research, with important implications for human resource management (HRM). However, although current managerial and organizational reviews include the concept of acculturation, little research has explored the concept of acculturation itself. Different perspectives on acculturation seem to exist, suggesting that the topic of acculturation has not grown uniformly in the field, and these differences have not been fully explored. This paper conducts an integrative review to examine the main perspectives of acculturation at the individual and organizational levels in management research, along with the strategic role HRM has played in them. Individual-level perspectives include a nonwork-cultural perspective, a work-cultural perspective, and a work-nonwork perspective. Organizational-level perspectives include a merger-fit perspective, a merger-integration perspective, an organizational-distance ­perspective, a diversity-management perspective, and an organizational-socialization perspective. We identify similarities, gaps, and limitations of research on acculturation at both the individual- and organizational-levels and discuss implications for future research. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the development of new organizational working models, such as new-work-from-home (nWFH). The new working models were not only primarily implemented in software development organizations using information technology but also in other types of organizations where nWFH was feasible. The sudden transition to work from home (WFH) gave rise to a new concept of nWFH, which was characterized by inadequate planning, design, or testing, thereby posing security risks to information systems. The existing body of literature pertaining to organizational readiness has primarily concentrated on large organizations, encompassing many contexts such as innovation, knowledge management, and healthcare. The concept of remote work, referred to as nWFH (New-Work from Home), has demonstrated diverse impacts on organizations under distinct contextual settings. The ability of large organizations to effectively move to remote operations is attributed to their prior experience and comfort with such practices, as well as their capacity to invest in robust software and technology solutions that provide high levels of security. Nevertheless, the implementation of remote work arrangements posed considerable challenges to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their limited past exposure and financial constraints. These variables increased their susceptibility to any decrease in production, even if it was only for a single day. Here by SMEs, we refer to the medium sized organizations. Medium-sized organizations are often the focus of cybercriminals due to their relatively insufficient security systems and processes when compared to larger organizations, making them vulnerable to assaults. As a result of the widespread adoption of remote work arrangements, medium-sized enterprises have exhibited a lower level of preparedness in managing their operations compared to larger organizations. Consequently, this research aims to solve this disparity specifically within the context of medium sized organizations. Exploratory methodology was employed in this study, wherein primary data was collected through in-depth interviews with a sample size of 20 subject matter experts from medium sized organizations. Through the application of content analysis on the transcripts of the interviews, our study has identified eleven distinct criteria that have a significant role in determining the level of organizational preparedness for information security risks in the context of remote work arrangements. In this study, we identified and examined six factors that have been previously discussed in the literature: resource readiness, cultural readiness, strategic readiness, information technology readiness, cognitive readiness, and partnership readiness. Additionally, we discovered five new factors through our research: security valence, cybersecurity risk management through “cyber insurance”, balanced confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), absence of work-from-home (WFH) policy, and organizational and technical best practices. We discuss the practical and research ramifications of this investigation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical regression analysis was used to test the proposed multilevel model on a sample of 407 employees working in Chinese companies. Findings: Task-technology fit stimulates employee innovative behavior through the regulation of creative self-expectations and positive emotions. When creative self-expectations is low, the promoting effect of task-technology fit on innovative behavior is enhanced. However, when creative self-expectations is too high, this effect is reversed due to employees’ preference for challenging and complex work. Practical implications: In the process of enterprise digital transformation, managers should not only focus on the alignment between employees' skills and individual task expectations, but also pay attention to employees' emotions and individual trait differences, to enhance the likelihood of innovative behavior occurrence and achieve successful enterprise digital transformation. Originality/value: This study enriches the research on task-technology fit and provides recommendations for organizations to achieve digital transformation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This article offers a new depth of understanding to this research by introducing and exploring the role of failure learning orientation. Specifically, the roles of market orientation, learning orientation, and failure learning orientation are explored with performance. Unlike previous literature, learning orientation did not mediate the market orientation and performance relationship. Instead, support was found for market orientation’s direct effect on performance and its indirect effect via failure learning orientation. The mediating role of failure learning orientation suggests that more specific learning typologies may alter the market orientation, learning orientation, and performance relationship. The study adds to existing market orientation research and the growing failure learning orientation literature.

This paper conducts a systematic literature review across eighty-six papers spanning over 25 years (1999–2023), to develop an overview of how leadership agility is conceptualized in the context of organisational agility in the extant literature. This systematic review was conducted using the PRISMA framework. The databases searched for the review were: EBSCO, Emerald Insight, JStor, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. The data thus collected was organised and integrated using reflective thematic synthesis. Literature suggests that leadership agility is one of the key dimensions to foster organisational agility, though challenging in practice and difficult to implement. Based on the analysis of extant literature, this paper identifies four emergent themes of leadership agility: Leadership Agility Mindsets; Leadership Agility Competencies; Leadership Agility Styles; and Leadership Organisational Agility Functions. This study has conceptualized a framework of leadership agility in the context of organisational agility, anchored in the interplay of the emergent themes and their categories, contributing to leadership agility research, and promoting its adoption by the practitioners. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to develop a multidimensional model of the new work environment in the digital age to increase a company's performance and competitiveness in VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) business environment. The multidimensional model covers the implementation of an agile work environment through the prism of using artificial intelligence technology to increase company's performance and competitiveness. Researched determined multidimensional aspects for successful implementation of work environment in the digital age are, therefore 1) drivers for shifting towards agility, 2) implementation of agile leadership, 3) implementation of an agile work environment, 4) implementation of AI technology in work environment, 5) company's performance, 6) competitiveness. The main survey involved randomly selected 473 medium-sized and large companies in Slovenia. Structural equation modelling was used for statistical data analysis. The results show that drivers for shifting towards agility have a positive effect on implementation of agile leadership. Also, results show that implementation of agile leadership and implementation of AI technology in work environment have a positive effect on implementation of an agile work environment. Moreover, results show that implementation of an agile work environment has positive effect on company's performance and competitiveness. The paper highlights the important multidimensional aspects of the successful implementation of an agile work environment to increase the company's performance and competitiveness. Also, our results will contribute to the proper implementation of the work environment in the digital age and give owners or top managers a broad insight into the various aspects that must be considered in their business governance in today's rapidly changing business environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

Based on qualitative expert interviews, a quantitative student survey, and current literature we derived requirements for an IDSA. Based on them, we designed, developed, and implemented a first IDSA prototype for higher education institutions (HEI). We continuously evaluated the prototype within different workshops and analyzed the usage data to improve it further in three enhanced prototypes. Based on this iterative process, we derived guidelines for an IDSA design and development. Accordingly, the framework, project management, content, team selection, team development, team communication, marketing, and student habits are important to consider.

Towards this direction, there is a growing interest in establishing corporate innovation ecosystems in the form of ‘corporate coworking spaces’ (CWS). From a relational ontological standpoint, this study builds on the collaborative spaces literature with the aim to investigate the emerging dynamics between corporates and start-ups in an innovation ecosystem. Through an abductive research strategy (ARS) as well as service design methods, we explore how co-creation between corporates and start-ups emerges (or not) in an innovation ecosystem that serves as a collaborative space in Denmark. Our empirical findings challenge the mostly overenthusiastic connotations and thus the study contributes to the critical coworking research stream. More specifically, we give emphasis on the co-constructive entanglement of socio-spatial arrangements and we propose a framework for revisiting the design of CWS through 1) balancing the engineered and evolving parts of the ecosystem, 2) facilitating stakeholder alignment, 3) adopting a service-oriented approach and 4) developing inclusive strategies. Apart from the implications for scholars and practitioners who study and design CWS, we argue that future research would especially benefit from building on a service-oriented approach of innovation ecosystems and we call for more interdisciplinary research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Rapid globalization during the last few decades has caused many difficulties for firms to survive, sustain, and maximize shareholders’ wealth. The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system provides extensive access to data and upgraded information to achieve the specified objectives. This study examines how Innovative Organizational Culture (IOC) affects firm performance in Pakistan. In doing so, this study collects a comprehensive dataset from 234 high- and medium-level managers working in different sectors across six major cities of Pakistan. We construct several hypotheses and employ Partial Least Squares Structural Equation modeling to test the selected premises. The results reveal that IOC and the benefits of ERP are positively related to firm performance, IOC is also positively associated with the implementation of ERP, and the implementation of ERP is positively related to the benefits of ERP. Regarding mediating relationship among the constructs, this study shows that the implementation of ERP mediates the relationship between IOC and the benefits of ERP and the benefits of ERP mediate the relationship between the implementation of ERP and firm performance. Given that Pakistan has been facing a chronic energy crisis for the last few decades, this study conducts a subsample analysis and divides the sample into two groups—“energy and manufacturing” and “service and non-manufacturing” sector firms. Our robustness tests reveal that the implementation of ERP is positively and significantly related to firm performance only in the subsample of service and non-manufacturing sector firms. In contrast, it is negatively and insignificantly related to firm performance in the subsample of energy and manufacturing sector firms. The findings of this study provide numerous operational insights to managers to adequately emphasize and strengthen IOC to sustain the change management system. Specifically, this study suggests that senior- and medium-level managers should continuously monitor the implementation of ERP and determinedly engage themselves in the team management and communication process to achieve higher firm performance.

Design/methodology/approach: This is self-reflective and action-oriented research on the affordances and constraints of two-mode virtual collaboration. In the spirit of professional development, the authors (nine researchers at different career stages and from various counties) engaged in a joint endeavour to evaluate the affordances and constraints of virtual collaborations in light of the recent literature while also researching the authors' own virtual collaboration during this evaluative task (mid-January–April 2021). The authors used two modes: synchronous (Zoom) and asynchronous (emails) to communicate on the literature exploration and recorded reactions and emotional responses towards existing affordances and constraints through a collective journal. Findings: The results suggest both affordances in terms of communication being negotiable and evolving and constraints, particularly in forming new relations given tools that may not be equally accessible to all. Journaling during collaborations could be a valuable tool, especially for virtual collective work, because it can be used to structure the team supported negotiation and discussion processes, especially often hidden processes. It is evident that the role of a leader can contribute to an alignment in the assumptions and experiences of trust and consequently foster greater mutual understanding of the circumstances for productive team collaborations. Originality/value: The findings of this study can inform academics and practitioners on how to create and facilitate better opportunities for collaboration in virtual teams as a rapidly emerging form of technology-supported working. © 2022, Irina A.

This paper reports on an Action Research project carried out in Lufthansa Systems Poland with the aim of (1) revisiting their ad-hoc actions to adapt to remote work; and (2) elaborating systematic solutions to maintain efficiency in such a setting. With our assistance, the participating teams found measures to mitigate issues posed by the new work environment. They devised an inter-team communication model to improve the effectiveness of information exchange that had declined in the absence of spontaneous, face-to-face communication. Moreover, they employed several other mitigation strategies, including working at least one day per week in the office, keeping webcams on during online meetings, and recapping meetings at the end of a session. Our study largely supports previous findings indicating that Scrum can be effectively applied beyond its comfort zone but also suggests that for adaptations to be successful and comprehensive, they should be developed in a structured manner. © 2023, The Author(s).},

For employees, implementing a change at work requires detaching from familiar routines and social systems, learning and practicing the change, and imagining a future in which the change is valued by the organization. As they apply their agency to implement change, employees may experience loss, uncertainty, and frustration that manifests as despair, which can jeopardize the change process and its outcomes. We assemble a meta-theoretical framework using human agency theory, the Valley of Despair model of organizational change, and Full-Range Leadership Theory to explore ways that leaders' behaviors relate to employees' agentic orientations and behaviors during the implementation phase of the organizational change process. Taking both organizational change leaders' and employees' perspectives into account, the theory derived from our meta-framework argues that leaders' behaviors can shape employees' agency and their behaviors during the implementation stage of change in two important ways: 1) certain leader behaviors are likely to prime agentic orientations that facilitate changing, and 2) certain leader behaviors may help to mitigate employees' despair, enabling the firm to derive value from employees' change implementation behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to illustrate the potential of coworking spaces as one way to achieve optimal workplace arrangements and corporate real estate (CRE) agility, especially for large organizations. The authors suggest understanding coworking spaces from the boundary organization theory and organizational growth model. Design/methodology/approach: This study takes a threefold theoretical approach: conducting a literature review and identifying the gaps in coworking studies for large organizations, applying the organizational boundary theory in tandem with organizational growth models in the context of coworking spaces as a part of the workplace ecology and identifying future research agendas for coworking studies. Findings: This study proposes a conceptual framework of how coworking spaces can be viewed and used as a boundary object throughout the organizational growth phases. Besides, four major future research areas are proposed: case studies and/or empirical evidence of coworking spaces as CRE buffer zones and boundary objects for organizations, coworking space design and different formats of boundary object-infused collaboration, coworking space design and management for its own agility and flexibility and how coworking affects employees’ performance, health and well-being and professional training/mentoring. Practical implications: For large organizations, there is a clear pressure to rethink CRE to increase workplace agility, flexibility and resilience, much accelerated with the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the effective use of coworking spaces as a part of CRE portfolios will help enhance corporates’ state and ability to reassess, realign and replan their CRE portfolios. Originality/value: Many existing studies about coworking spaces are based on observations and self-reported justification at an individual level. Whether and how coworking can benefit companies at an organizational level is largely unstudied and worth more attention. This study illustrates a new theoretical understanding of how coworking spaces can be a part of CRE portfolios and bring potential benefits of inter and intraorganizational collaboration throughout the phases of organizational growth. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Australia lags globally in equipping youth with enterprise skills. Enterprise Education (eE) is seen as having potential value to every student, being transformative in nature providing students an opportunity to develop a range of entrepreneurial competencies such as self-efficacy, creativity, problem-solving, confidence and lifelong learning habits deemed important for the world of work (Foundation for Young Australians in The new work order. Ensuring young Australians have skills and experience for the jobs of the future, not the past. https://www.fya.org.au/app/uploads/2021/09/new-work-order-2015.pdf, 2017; Jones in How to teach entrepreneurship. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2019). In recent years there has been a significant push for entrepreneurial skills to be taught in Australian schools to prepare students for life and contribute to the future of work. Moreover, there is no mandated policy to recognise the place and value of the positioning of Entrepreneurial Education (EE) in the Australian school curriculum. Additionally, the formal assessment process for determining whether students achieve the capabilities associated with the development of entrepreneurial skills is also absent. Given that these skills are not formally developed or assessed in schools, the focus should be directed at teaching all children the enterprising capabilities from an early age, today, to prepare them for action tomorrow and to help capitalise on the new ecosystem of entrepreneurs and innovators that the nation is building in order to remain competitive and enable young people to thrive in a dynamic and ever-changing world.

	abstract = {The seismic shifts in B2B selling brought about by the recent global pandemic have left scholars grappling with the fundamental question of permanence. As the traditional face-to-face dynamics of B2B sales stand challenged, academic minds seek answers: Are these changes enduring, or will we revert to the familiar norms of in-person interactions? A Critical Examination of the Recent Evolution of B2B Salesis a groundbreaking exploration designed for academic scholars seeking clarity in these uncertain times. In the pursuit for understanding, scholars encounter a myriad of questions. What truly transpired in sales activities during the pandemic? Does the surge in virtual selling signify a lasting transformation, or is it merely a temporary adaptation? Critical thinking becomes paramount, necessitating a deep dive into published ideas to discern the strength of conclusions drawn. The academic community grapples with the challenge of scrutinizing the landscape to determine if the changes are indeed permanent and if so, how B2B sales forces can effectively adapt. A Critical Examination of the Recent Evolution of B2B Sales serves as the intellectual compass for scholars navigating the evolving B2B sales terrain. Through meticulously crafted chapters, it dissects the impact of the pandemic on sales activities, decodes the essence of B2B sales, and critically examines the rise of virtual selling. Armed with an array of critical thinking tools, scholars can scrutinize existing ideas, assess the permanence of observed changes, and chart a course for the future of B2B sales. This book offers a comprehensive solution, empowering academics to not only understand but actively contribute to the ongoing discourse on the future of B2B selling.. © 2024 by IGI Global..

	abstract = {Troubled construction projects are a global problem. Iraqi construction projects thus naturally suffer from this phenomenon, and, indeed, most Iraqi government construction projects suffer issues during the implementation phase that increase both costs and time; completing a construction project within the planned cost and time limits has thus become a major challenge for all parties involved in the construction process in Iraq. Projects are rarely carried out within the estimated and planned boundaries, mainly due to the fact that most projects in the construction industry must deal with unwanted and unexpected events during their various phases that directly influence the basic project objectives, causing delays and sending work over budget, and potentially even leading to project failure. The research problem this highlights lies in the presence of so many troubled government projects in the construction sector: the purpose of the current research is to identify the major causes or critical factor affecting project performance and success. It is important to determine the types of factors causing trouble for Iraqi governmental projects in order for these to be more specifically mitigated or avoided in the future. Such an understanding should also assist all construction industry stakeholders seeking to increase the success of their projects, allowing construction professionals and other industry practitioners to take proactive actions to ensure more effective building project management. The research methodology was based on collecting and analysing various sources of information and data from Iraqi governmental projects, with such data collected from several sources. The research object thus consists of all public sector projects including buildings, roads, and bridges. The findings confirm the existence of many troubled projects in the construction sector in Iraq: the percentage of troubled building projects was 59.76%, while the percentage of troubled road and bridge projects was 92%. Many important factors that affected budgets and durations in the examined projects were thus discovered and classified according to the project parties and the stages of the projects affected. The findings show that, according to the impact on cost, the design and execution stages, have the most impact on building project issues, as do the consultant and the project owner, with road and bridge projects more likely to encounter issues. Similarly, change orders due to the addition of new works necessary to complete the work, as well as those due to inaccurate BOT in building projects or due to designers not visiting the site to checking it before completing a design cause issues, with the latter problem being compounded by aa lack of accuracy of topographic surveys. Changes in specifications in roads and bridge projects have a particular impact on project duration. The results indicated that executing and contracting stages had more impact in building projects, while executing and design stages had the most impact in road and bridge projects. Overall, the most important trouble factors were delayed payment to contractors due to financial crisis procedures for withdrawing work and the re-advertisement of bids during building projects and road and bridge projects. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The novel coronavirus has caused problems in all business sectors, including Information Technology(IT). Many Projects have been stopped or delayed due to the impact of this pandemic. Most of the companies recognized the importance of IT to achieve competitive advantage and to survive. Companies are investing a lot of money in IT projects. More than 60% of IT project fail. Lack of professional IT project management is one of the main reasons for that fail. Managing IT projects is a complex problem. Crises such as COVID 19 and uncertainty are increasing the complexity and challenges in IT projects management. This paper investigates what are the IT project management Key success factors required during and after the Pandemic. Secondary data were collected from literature review in the field of IT project management. an online questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from 107 IT firms. 323 respondents were participated. It is concluded that the following Key success factors are required: e-communication, centralization of data, online project monitoring, designing new policies and guidelines for incorporating new work culture, gaining and establishing project risk management exercises, especially cybersecurity and data protection by gaining access to the latest tools, establishing a culture for strict usage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to help project managers complete projects safely, and top management support.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Bearing this in mind, entrepreneurs devote special attention to define strategies, monitor entrepreneurial indicators and recruiting qualified employees. In this sense, organizations need to rely on an efficient measurement system with vast and complex information. Considering this need, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) embraces a short-, medium-and long-term time horizon and guides entrepreneurs in the measurement of their Key Performance Indicators (KPI), as acknowledged by the well-known company like Apple, which is using BSC for planning and performance measurement. Furthermore, as the KPIs need to reflect organisational performance, the interconnection of BSC with SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is considered of benefit. By means of this interlinkage, performance is monitored in an integrated way, as the flow of material and information of the whole chain is integrated and interlinked via ERP. Stressing out that several BSC implementations have failed, this research, intends to detail how ERP implementation can leverage the BSC’s features, namely to monitor entrepreneur’s strategy. As several studies have focused their attention in an isolated way and several BSC implementations failed, this research sheds light on entrepreneur’s strategy leveraged and monitored by the interrelation of ERP and BSC. © 2024, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics.

A qualitative approach is adopted, and semi-structured interviews are conducted across two university cases with 40 academics and students to capture their perceptions of LMS usage. We found that technical paradoxes present a barrier to pedagogical development in the transition from blended learning environments to remote ones, where many wicked and unprecedented challenges emerge from learning remotely during a pandemic, while social paradoxes arise from cultural issues such as user resistance that impede the university's pedagogical goals and visions. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, the purpose of the study is to analyze the role of agile women leadership and team effectiveness by looking into the mediating effect of interpersonal trust based on a cross-sectional quantitative study with a sample of 269 employees from Poland and Turkey. Questionnaires were distributed to individuals in companies having women leaders or managers. The three questionnaires required the respondents to answer questions regarding the perception of agile leadership, trust and team effectiveness. By using SPSS, demographics, descriptive statistics and tests of normality were determined. Smart PLS version 3.0 was used for confirmatory factor analysis, internal accuracy and validity estimates, hypothesis checking and mediation testing. Results of PLS-SEM indicated interpersonal trust has a full mediation role between agile women leadership in shaping team effectiveness. The population of this study are working for organizations of just two countries; hence, the generalizability of the findings to other settings is unknown. Our findings contribute to the literature on women agile leadership and team effectiveness by demonstrating how the growth in trust to managers contributes to the emergence of team effectiveness and the agile leadership trend over time. This study will therefore contribute to the understanding of organized teams’ effectiveness in the perspective of agile women leadership and trust of supervisors. © 2022 by the authors.

However, organizations are struggling to develop and sustain their intraorganizational online collaboration (IOC) capabilities organization-wide. Hence, holistic approaches to effectively manage this capability are needed. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a maturity model for intraorganizational online collaboration. The model builds on related maturity models and research of the domain. In a four-round ranking-type Delphi study, essential capability areas for IOC were identified and refined, and a general maturation path was developed. Compared to related maturity models, the presented maturity model addresses the specific domain focus of online collaboration within an organization from an organization-wide perspective. The model provides a framework for design elements for intraorganizational online collaboration and a highly reliable general maturation path. © 2023 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {During the Covid-19 pandemic, the earnings of migrant workers decreased due to joblessness and the lack of new work. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to look at the potential of rural entrepreneurship as a form of financially managing the insecurity and vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic. The literature review shows that although international migration has played a crucial role in economic growth in Bangladesh, remittance has been underutilized and not translated into investment usually. The qualitative research methodology of the paper followed the thematic analysis design method to apprehend and explain the research findings. The findings of the study indicate that despite several challenges, rural entrepreneurship can indeed be a sustainable livelihood alternative that improves the resilience of returnee migrants. The right kinds of skillsets and adequate measures to tackle the infrastructural and socio-political barriers can boost rural entrepreneurship appreciably. Other recently published research works also highlight that entrepreneurship can be an effective tool for the reintegration of returnee migrants. This paper concludes that the sustainability of rural entrepreneurship will require engaging local development organizations, forming incubation and support centers, and organizing peer support groups. © 2023, Small Business Institute.

Therefore, this study addressed these characteristics by using mathematical statistics to analyse 825 accidents in Inner Mongolia in the past 5 years and then developed a set of management strategies for administrators. The results showed that (1) regarding temporal characteristics, production safety accidents occurred more frequently in summer and autumn than in winter, and there were more accidents and deaths on weekends. (2) Regarding spatial characteristics, the frequency and mortality of accidents exhibited spatial differences in prefecture-level cities (e.g., accidents in Baotou and Tongliao were more frequent) and at county scales (e.g., accidents in Horqin and Kundulun were more frequent). (3) Regarding the characteristics of industries with accidents: the high-risk industry was captured, i.e., construction and mining, and accidents mainly consisted of high-altitude falls and mechanical injuries. These findings suggest that administrative and enterprise managers should pay attention to the characteristics of the spatio-temporal distribution patterns, highly hazardous accident types, and high-risk industries and design more suitable strategies for production safety training and supervision to reduce the frequency of accidents and casualties. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {International student migration makes a significant contribution to higher education in the United Kingdom, with Southern Africa, and Nigeria in particular, positioned joint sixth in the top ten of sending countries. Many of these student-migrants, in supplementing their finances to fund their studies in the United Kingdom, undertake employment. Temporary and/or part-time employment is integral to the student-migrant experience, despite the express purpose of their admission into the United Kingdom designated for study purposes and not work. This explicit object is reflected in restrictions affixed to international students' employment rights whilst studying; they are generally restricted to a maximum of 20 hours of work per week during term time and proscribed from working full time or as independent contractors. Given the scant regard this topic has received in the existing literature, this study offers an examination of students' lived employment experiences under these rules. Adopting a qualitative methodology through interviews and ethnographic observations with cohorts of international student workers from sub-Saharan Africa, the study presents a holistic picture of the lived experiences, through employment practices, of this group of student-migrant-workers. The study aims to offer contributions to the existing body of literature in two principal ways. First, it accounts for the employment experiences of student-migrants through the analytical framework of 'precarity' by examining the various manifestations of insecurity in the students' lived realities, nuanced by structures of migration control and labour market temporalities. The study highlights that these students are forced to contend with intersecting forms of insecurities in their labour market encounters. This reifies their dependence on certain forms of employment and relationships, and renders them increasingly susceptible to unfavourable work conditions including low pay, exploitation, discrimination and abuse. This aspect of the study is concluded by advancing an argument that higher education institutions, as the primary sponsors of these students, must do more to forearm them with candid insights on what to expect of the temporary employment market and furnish them with a comprehensive knowledge of their accruable employment rights. For the second contribution, adopting the socio-legal schema of legal consciousness, the study considers the student-migrants' relationship with the law by way of the legal restrictions on their employment and interrogates their agency in their efforts to derogate from these rules. These derogations are conceptualised as 'semi-legality', an analytical construct that marks an indeterminate halfway point between utter illegality and compliance, as it applies to labour. The study highlights that there are two discernible plots towards enabling semi-legal employment and evading detection thereof. The first involves the students undertaking work with different employers simultaneously; meanwhile, the second entails students contracting for work through the use of private limited companies as a trading structure. The study argues that the specifics of the student's violation of visa rules has profound distinctive implications for their legal consciousness' disposition and more so the manner in which they simultaneously resist and make recourse to the law and its institutions towards resolving workplace grievances. © James Marson, Mohammed Dirisu, and Katy Ferris 2022.

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that impact the behavioral intention to use social media (SM) for knowledge sharing (KS) in the disaster relief (DR) context. Background With the continuing growth of SM for KS in the DR environment, disaster relief organizations across the globe have started to realize its importance in streamlining their processes in the post-implementation phase. However, SM-based KS depends on the willingness of members to share their knowledge with others, which is affected by several technological, social, and organizational factors. Methodology A survey was conducted in Somalia to gather primary data from DR practitioners, using purposive sampling as the technique. The survey collected 214 valid responses, which were then analyzed with the PLS-SEM approach. Contribution The study contributes to an understanding of the real-life hurdles faced by disaster relief organizations by expanding on the C-TAM-TPB model with the inclusion of top management support, organizational rewards, enjoyment in helping others, knowledge self-efficacy, and interpersonal trust factors. Additionally, it provides useful recommendations to managers of disaster relief organizations on the key factors to consider. Findings The findings recorded that perceived usefulness, ease of use, top management support, enjoyment in helping others, knowledge self-efficacy, and interpersonal trust were critical factors in determining behavioral intention (BI) to use SM-based KS in the DR context. Furthermore, the mediator variables were attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Recommendations Based on the research findings, it was determined that management should crefor Practitioners ate different discussion forums among the disaster relief teams to ensure the long-term use of SM-based KS within DR organizations. They should also become involved in the discussions for disaster-related knowledge such as food supplies, shelter, or medical relief that disaster victims need. Disaster relief managers should consider effective and adequate training to enhance individual knowledge and self-efficacy since a lack of training may increase barriers and difficulties in using SM for KS during a DR process. Recommendations The conceptual model, further empirically investigated, can be employed by for Researchers other developing countries in fostering acceptance of SM for KS during disaster relief operations. Impact on Society Disaster relief operations can be facilitated using social media by considering the challenges DR practitioners face during emergencies. Future Research In generalizing this study’s findings, other national or global disaster relief organizations should consider, when applying and testing, the research instruments and proposed model. The researchers may extend this study by collecting data from managers or administrators since they are different types of users of the SM-based KS system. © 2023 Informing Science Institute.

The approach taken in this paper is different. This paper is prepared by students who participated in a multidisciplinary capstone project, and it presents first-hand highlights of the student-participants' perspective of their experiences as a response to multidisciplinary teaching interventions. The paper emphasizes the importance for college graduates to develop multidisciplinary collaboration skills and competencies for successful employment. A summary of various approaches practiced in higher education to provide opportunities for multidisciplinary learning, including capstone projects, is outlined in the literature review. The paper describes goals, objectives, and outcomes of a project assigned to a multidisciplinary capstone team. The authors outline organization of the multidisciplinary student collaboration in the project, team structure, project activities, and communication and teamwork practices. Students' learning experiences, including benefits, challenges, and lessons learned are discussed in the paper, presenting different points of view from different disciplines. Relevance of multidisciplinary teaching for student career goals and value for their professional development are discussed in the paper. The authors provide suggestions for improvements and advice to instructors and peers for improving multidisciplinary learning experiences at the college level. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.},

	abstract = {Abstract : Despite the increasing importance of open innovation endeavors, the process by which firms select partners for open innovation is not well understood. Even less is known about how family firms, which are characterized by their resource scarcity and desire for control, handle these processes. We aim to address this gap in the literature by investigating this selection process using a qualitative approach. Our findings are based on data gathered in 53 interviews from ten case studies and expert interviews, as well as secondary data. We find that, in order to engage in collaboration, family firms must manage their perceptions of the similarities and complementarities between themselves and their potential partner and integrate these into an accepted level of anticipated fit. During the selection phase, the elements of fit are weighed in light of the openness of the given firm and preferred levels and mechanisms of control, which are influenced by the family in the family firm. If the fit is deemed sufficient to enter into a partnership, the partnership is then advanced to the collaboration phase, where anticipated fit is translated into experienced fit, and aspects of similarity and complementarity are reassessed; this may potentially end existing partnerships, feeding back to future evaluations of fit and accordingly influencing future partnerships. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The new paradigm in employee development assumes that employees should proactively direct their learning and growth. Most workplace learning is basically informal and occurs through daily-work routines, peer-to-peer interactions, and networking, and typically brings about signifi cant positive outcomes to both individuals and organizations. Yet, workplace learning always occurs in a predefi ned context and this context has recently changed. Hereafter, many people have been delegated to work from home or any other remote location. Many employees would like to maintain remote or hybrid work design in the future, as well. In this research monograph, the authors explore an unexplored topic in social science research concerning proactive employee development through informal learning in new ways of working (NWW). The monograph will be of interest to students and researchers in organizational studies, organizational behavior, organizational psychology, and organizational learning, as well as human resource professionals concerned with employee development and the changing nature of work. © 2024 Malgorzata Rozkwitalska-Welenc, Beata A.

This has resulted in the modification of the goals of both startup and cooperative models, leading to the emergence of a new hybrid business model combining the two and known as cooperative startups. The present study aims to investigate the evolution, functioning and characteristics of cooperative startups as a potential research area that may be of future relevance due to its potential growth. To this end, a bibliometric analysis using Web of Sciences academic database and VOSViewer software is conducted to identify specific characteristics, opportunities, and challenges that cooperative startups should understand in order to achieve business success. In this regard, a co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling and keyword concurrency analysis are computed to understand the literature published in this research field to date. The findings of this analysis contribute to the creation of knowledge on cooperative startups identifying 19 future research questions linked to 5 research categories in cooperatives startups: strategy, members of the team, performance, finance and economy and innovation. The results provide insights on the challenges and characteristics of this new business model that is characterized by the management of investments and economy democracy while boosting innovation and handling competence.

In terms of hard information, the outcomes reveal that organization size, registration date, prior project initiation experience, and the organization's rating wield a noteworthy influence over the ultimate crowdfunding performance. Conversely, when considering soft information, the presence of negative emotional signals in crowdfunding texts was found to positively correlate with fundraising success. However, emotional intensity exhibited a negative impact on fundraising performance. These findings have substantial implications for practitioners engaged in environmental crowdfunding endeavors. When initiating a project, the creator should demonstrate his or her competence as much as possible to enhance credibility and in addition, should try to show negative signals in the text. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to enrich our understanding of the characteristics of non-urban coworking spaces (CSs) that focus on corporate users, as well as the benefits that companies expect to gain from incorporating those CSs into their corporate real estate (CRE) portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: This study leverages a series of in-depth interviews with owners and managers of CSs in non-urban locales that focus on serving corporate clients. Findings: The research reveals various CS characteristics and forms within non-urban areas, focusing on corporate clients. It suggests that implementing a CS in corporate premises is perceived to enhance CRE use-value strategies with a focus on the employee's well-being, innovation and the attraction of talents. Moreover, exchange-value strategies with a focus on portfolio flexibility may benefit from the implementation of a CS. However, strategies related to life-cycle cost optimization or gains are not perceived to be supported. Social events for the surrounding neighborhood and the choice of location emerge as critical success factors for non-urban CSs. Besides infrastructure and connectivity, non-urban corporate-centric CSs built their location decisions rather on a personal connection to the location and place of residence of potential users than on lower rental prices. Originality/value: This research pioneers in providing a comprehensive understanding of non-urban CSs, particularly in the context of their perceived implications for corporate real estate management. The nuanced perspectives it offers are invaluable for stakeholders looking to leverage CSs as part of their corporate strategies. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study primarily aims to investigate the relationship between the success factors and Agile project management methodology adoption and examine the moderating effect of perceived compatibility. The technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and technology acceptance theories (UTAUT, IDT, and TAM) were applied as the theoretical foundation of the current study. A survey questionnaire method was employed to achieve the study objectives, while quantitative primary data were gathered using a carefully designed methodological approach focusing on Omani oil and gas industry. The PLS-SEM technique and SmartPLS software were used for hypotheses testing and data analysis. Resultantly, readiness, technology utilization, organizational factors, and perceived compatibility were the significant factors that promoted Agile methodology adoption in the oil and gas industry. Perceived compatibility moderated the relationship between success factors and Agile methodology. The findings suggested that people, technology, and organizational factors facilitate the Agile methodology under the technology acceptance theories and frameworks. Relevant stakeholders should adopt the study outcomes to improve Agile methodology adoption. © 2023 by author(s).

	abstract = {Workplace Monitoring and Technology aims to showcase results of research and explanatory theories that influence employees' acceptance of the fact that work is monitored using ICT-based monitoring tools. Work monitoring, understood as obtaining, storing and reporting the results of collected observations, has always been a managerial task. Traditionally it was carried out by supervisors who, while overseeing the work of employees, would draw conclusions from their observations and implement corrective actions. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to monitor the working employee and their performance has changed the methods of monitoring, and the popularization of remote work has increased interest in searching for new monitoring systems using the full potential of new ICT solutions. The new developments in ICT have caused smart monitoring systems and new solutions to evolve in electronic work monitoring based on the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, which enables nearly cost-free monitoring. However, scientific knowledge about them is limited, and above all, so is managerial knowledge about the reception of these tools by employees, while their misuse can cause considerable damage. Presenting a broad overview of the current state of different areas of scientific knowledge regarding smart and electronic monitoring systems of work performance, this book will be of relevance for academics within the fields of human resource management and performance management, and for similar groups of researchers in psychology and sociology. © 2023 Jacek Woźniak.},

	abstract = {Digitalisation has a wide range of impacts on the workplace, such as enabling new work models with flexible work sched-ules, changing work content, or increasing workplace control. These changes directly affect not only individuals’ work but also their private lives. Scholars theorise that digitalisation either enables or impedes workers’ ability to maximise their work–life balance, which in turn fosters or inhibits the social inclusion of some societal groups and reduces or reproduces social inequalities. Focusing on the German healthcare sector, I explore the impact of using networked digital technologies on work–life balance, and whether it influences gender and educational inequalities. Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered. To assess the relationship between digitalisation and work–life balance, I use survey data from hospital employees on the use of networked digital technologies and individual outcomes. The research is designed as a natural experiment. The treatment group comprises employees at a university hospital equipped with cutting‐edge networked digital technologies (N = 1,117); the control group comprises employees at several church‐owned hospitals (N = 415) with a level of digitalisation corresponding to the average for the sector. I first discuss confounders and then employ quantitative methods to establish a link between digitalisation and work–life balance, assess its direction, and address gender and educational inequalities. © 2023 by the author(s);.},

Today, the LP approach faces challenges of the growing complexity of the global market. To ensure a long-term success, companies need to adapt to shorter delivery time, increasing product variability and high market volatility, and react to continuous and unexpected changes sensitively and timely at reasonable costs (Moeuf, et al., 2020).In this chapter, we introduce the core theoretical frameworks and their applications in industrial practice. Finally, we discuss how Industry 4.0 technologies could be implemented in a production setup with a LP structure and demonstrate possible results with a case study. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Because of this complexity, governing technology and data to support artificial intelli- gence (AI) capability has proven to be a difficult task that-according to experts-requires a systems perspective in its design and implementation. In this article, we take a conceptual approach to respond to this call from experts by providing working definitions of both enterprise data governance and a systems approach to management. Using these working definitions and data from municipal governments in Mexico, we develop a system dynamics model to explore some potential tradeoffs in the process of developing an enterprise view of information systems and data to create capability to develop AI applications in government. Simulation experiments suggest that an emphasis on governance of IT may create a strong foundation for the development of AI capability.  Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).},

Although they are mid-career in a different professional field, the Army invests in these soldiers as college faculty members in order for them to teach, mentor, and serve as role models for college students (also known as cadets). This chapter highlights a special federal investment in these soldiers as college faculty. This mid-career program, the University of Louisville/Army Master Educator Course, is a two-semester-long educational intervention to equip soldiers with graduate-level experience in college teaching and learning, student success, higher education administration, and organizational change with a community action research lens. The benefits of this program include expanding campus networks, educating campus leaders about ROTC programs, gaining more program resources, designing new interdisciplinary programming, strengthening student advising and development, focusing on student success factors, and focusing an equity lens on decision-making and implementation. Simply put, the program offers soldiers who are at the mid-career stage but new to the academy a set of tools and techniques to examine, frame, execute, and improve cadet experiences. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vicki L.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose that millennials – those born between 1980 and 1995 – are uniquely impacted by the long-term impact of the pandemic, which has accelerated the work from home movement and exacerbated organizational issues associated with working remotely. Millennials, on the cusp of embarking on important leadership roles in this new remote work environment, pose challenges and opportunities for organizations will that will last long after the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a viewpoint based on a narrative review and on the authors’ professional experiences within organizations. Based upon these findings, this paper has reimagined the Mumford skills model to explore millennial managers in this new remote work, post-pandemic context. The goal of this narrative review was to provide a full picture of the “Millennial manager” and the challenges they face in becoming effective managers, as well as highlight the important strengths they bring to the table. Findings: Managers may have challenges regarding job satisfaction, productivity and organizational commitment. The positive factors are millennials prefer flexibility, teamwork and creating a positive work-life balance. The negative side has to do with isolation and the ability to embrace the organization culture in a remote environment. This model shows positive and limiting factors of millennials related to organization effectiveness. The major propositions and model were that millennium managers in this new environment increase interpersonal communication to maintain trust, effective mentoring, resolve strong organizational culture and ensure effective delegation and conflict resolution. Practical implications: This study discovered challenges for managers, including developing loyalty and improving employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Active listening is necessary for team management to show that all team members are valued irrespective of the work environment. Active listening and empathy will increase social support at work, which improves personal well-being and productivity. Millennials will continue to use their technological skills, their desire for teamwork and their preference for participative management, resulting in becoming an invaluable asset in this era of organizational transformation. The challenge for organizations is to realize the millennial generation possesses many talents and must successfully engage them in the pursuit of organizational goals. Originality/value: This paper adds to the body of knowledge regarding millennials in organizations with a specific focus on the new work environment created by the global pandemic. The authors hope that their adapted skills model – the millennial manager skills model – becomes an important resource for articulation this new environment that millennial managers are in and that this model can be further refined and expanded through empirical exploration. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of organisational agility on environmental knowledge as an instrument for the successful development of eco-innovation in products. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a cross-sectional design to collect data on the study variables from a sample of 184 Spanish manufacturing organisations. Structural equations with partial least squares were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Organisational agility is significantly linked to internal and external environmental knowledge. The results of this study highlight the effect of external knowledge on the success of eco-innovation. Internal environmental knowledge positively moderates the effect of external knowledge on the success of green products. Research limitations/implications: Based on the dynamic capabilities approach, a theoretical model has been proposed in which organisational agility is configured as an effective capacity for the development of environmental knowledge. The results confirm this relationship and indicate that, although internal environmental knowledge is not decisive in developing new green products, it does enhance the effect of external knowledge on the success of eco-innovation. Practical implications: Innovative companies must implement organisational agility practices that promote environmental knowledge for the success of new green products. They should also promote both external and internal knowledge. Originality/value: This study addresses the little explored area of the relationship between organisational agility and the successful development of new green products. The inherent particularities of eco-innovation prompt the need for further studies on the creation of specific knowledge for its promotion. This study concludes that adopting agile practices enables key environmental knowledge for this type of innovation to be created. Additionally, it explores the tensions arising from the dichotomy between internal and external knowledge, with scarce resources allocated to the most effective source. Although both types of knowledge seem to be equally relevant, external knowledge plays a more significant role in the case of eco-innovation. A final contribution of this study is the finding that internal knowledge can further enhance the effect of external knowledge on the development of successful green products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Driven by the potential for individual, project, and organisational benefits through a deeper comprehension of these challenges, our study draws upon role identity theories to uncover identity tensions that this role creates and ways in which ITPMs engage in identity work to resolve these tensions. We conducted an in-depth, qualitative study involving interviews with ITPMs operating within agile ISD teams embedded in traditionally-managed organisations. A central contribution of our paper lies in the development of a theoretical model that unpacks how ITPMs navigate identity work tensions by engaging in specific identity work activities. By revealing the interplay between ITPMs’ role identity tensions, identity work activities, and contextual factors, our study moves beyond purely descriptive accounts and offers a nuanced understanding of the emotional and behavioural dimensions of ITPMs in their liminal position. Additionally, our work underscores the pivotal role of ITPMs as boundary spanners, bridging the gap between traditional and agile governance structures to drive digital transformation. For practitioners, we provide agile ISD team design recommendations. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The book explores the capabilities of deep learning to provide smart solutions for the construction industry, particularly in areas of managing equipment, design optimization, energy optimization and detect cracks for buildings and highways. It provides conceptual solutions but also practical techniques. A new deep learning CNN-based highway cracks detection is demonstrated, and its usefulness is tested. The resulting deep learning CNN model will enable users to scan long distance of highway and detect types of cracks accurately in a very short time compared to traditional approaches. The book explores the integration of IoT and blockchain to provide practical solutions to tackle existing challenges like the endemic fragmentation in supply chain, the need for monitoring construction projects remotely and tracking equipment on the site. The Blockchain of Things (BCoT) concept has been introduced to exploit the advantages of IoT and blockchain, and different applications were developed based on this integration in leading industries such as shared economy and health care. Workable potential use cases to exploit successful utilization of BCoT for the construction industry are explored in the book’s chapters. This book will appeal to researchers in providing a comprehensive review of related literature on blockchain, the IoT and construction identify gaps and offer a springboard for future research. Construction practitioners, research and development institutes and policy makers will also benefit from its usefulness as a reference book and collection of case studies on the application of these new approaches in construction. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

As a result, an industry’s value chain is transformed. This introduces the urge of reengineering the processes to develop an integrated system, which introduces new challenges and difficulties at organisational and managerial levels. This system leads to the birth of a new work environment to cope up with the need for new interactions between humans and robots. As a result, expectations rise from employers where employees will have to develop their skills constantly, hence being proactive to change rather than reactive. Change management literature on several bases has shown that introduction of significant changes within a firm affects employees’ well-being, where employees are found to suffer from serious stress. On a national level, Bahrain’s 2030 vision as well highlights that the skills of citizens need to be developed as a strategy to maintain competitive advantage on a global scale.

	abstract = {“New Work” is not really a very new concept. However, it has drawn significant additional attention in the last couple of years—not least due to the special situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. WFH seems to be a new normal in the modern business environment. Still, it appears that there are numerous challenges attached with the implementation of these nascent processes in the daily business operations of many organizations. The infrastructure and equipment might need adjustments to accommodate new forms of cooperation. Knowledge transfer and collaboration need to be organized differently compared with the way it was done in traditional offices. New skills and leadership styles seem to be necessary to flourish in the new work culture. Managers are required to facilitate communication and collaboration. Informal networks can have a crucial role in this context. Organizations may benefit from an enhanced corporate culture that takes into consideration incentives for knowledge sharing and mentoring. This is not only relevant for the onboarding of new employees but can also be a key success factor for the organization’s long-term success. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

These areas, ranging from corporate innovation to entrepreneurship education and transitional entrepreneurship, are critical for academic investigation and hold potential for significant societal impact. These domains are not intended to constitute a ‘top 10’ list, nor are they exhaustive; rather, they are intended to help guide scholars toward research domains we believe are ripe for exploration and with the potential to be highly impactful. These domains embody the field’s ever-evolving nature, encapsulating the entrepreneurial spirit as a quilt of interconnected patches rather than isolated pieces. They encourage an interdisciplinary approach, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial activity. As the entrepreneurship literature grows, its adaptability will be crucial for theoretical advancement and practical applications.

Despite many efforts to green supply chain collaboration (GSCC), the research on how to enhance it from a technological perspective remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to address this gap by exploring how to enhance green supplier, internal and customer collaboration through using information technology (IT) and advanced manufacturing technology (AMT), which further accelerates environmental and economic performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted based on survey data collected from 213 manufacturing firms from different industries. The direct effects of the conceptual model were tested using the method of structural equation modeling (SEM), whereas the bootstrapping method tested the mediation effects of AMT between IT and GSCC. Findings: The results show that green supplier collaboration (GSC) is significantly associated with environmental performance, while green customer collaboration (GCC) is positively related to economic performance. Green internal collaboration not only enhances green supplier and customer collaboration but also boosts environmental and economic performance. IT directly improves green internal collaboration but is negatively related to GSC and insignificantly related to GCC. However, AMT not only enhances green internal, supplier and customer collaboration but also mediates the relationship between IT and green supplier and customer collaboration. Originality/value: This study offers comprehensive and novel insights into GSCC from a technological perspective, giving rise to meaningful contributions to green practices for both scholars and practitioners. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Three large-scale surveys from three different points in time, with a total of 1880 observations from varied geographical regions, are used to offer generalizable evidence on how firm size influences the implementation and performance outcome of technology, lean, quality and human resource practices. Findings: The four manufacturing practices positively enhance performance: quality and lean practices produce the most consistent effects, while technology and human resource practices turn more beneficial in the latest sample. Furthermore, the authors offer robust support for the selection and mediation models (larger firms generally invest more in the four practices and, through that, achieve higher performance), while finding no evidence for the moderation model (smaller firms can equally benefit if they possess the resources to invest in these practices). Originality/value: As manufacturing practices are continuously evolving, their performance impact cannot be guaranteed in any context. Size is a frequently used contingency variable in OM studies, but results are contradictory in terms of its impact on the implementation and performance outcomes of manufacturing practices. This study manages to ease these contradictions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

There is little evidence on the conditions that lead managers to engage in the design of healthier working conditions for employees. The superior role of organizational norms and their interactions with other TPB predictors could be empirically confirmed using regression analyses with parallel mediation. Based on longitudinally collected data, the study could show that health-related organizational norms are of importance in attracting managers to design health-promoting working conditions. The results provide indications why these norms have an impact on health-promoting leadership behavior. The results can be used for the theoretical further development of the process model of “healthy leadership” by identifying essential action-guiding conditions that encourage managers to lead in a health-promoting manner. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature 2024.

	abstract = {Purpose: Most global business organisations have begun to explore and embrace new work practices (NWPs) in reorganising their workplace strategies to enhance performance and face intense competition in the global market. This study aims to examine whether or not NWPs are being implemented in office occupying firms in Hong Kong and explore the drivers of the NWPs. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 16 NWPs and 20 drivers were identified through the extant literature review and assessed through a questionnaire survey conducted in the finance, insurance, real estate and business (FIREB) service firms. Based on a comprehensive questionnaire survey, a quantitative approach was used to discover the occurrence of the NWPs in those firms and the driving factors. Based on the questionnaires retrieved, descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was conducted. The relationships between the NWPs occurrence and the driving factors were also investigated to draw necessary inferences. Findings: The results showed that all of the 16 NWPs identified from the literature are happening in Hong Kong FIREB firms. The results of the analysis also indicated that virtual collaboration positively drive the occurrence of NWPs in FIREB firms. Interestingly, innovation in business was shown as such that does not necessarily necessitate stringent hiring strategy. Practical implications: This research may be of practical value for workplace strategists to make better, more careful forecasts of future workplace trends to ensure resource utilisation and improve space usage patterns and employee productivity. Originality/value: This paper presents comprehensive overview of drivers that designers, developers, investors, facility managers and planners can use to provide sustainable NWPs. The study will enrich the growing body of international literature on implementing NWPs in global business organisations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 pushed organizations towards the adoption of new ways of organizing the workplace, to contrast the diffusion of the virus as well as to ensure the production of goods and services. Many workers and employers were suddenly forced to switch to forms of remote work, quite often without any real preparation to successfully deal with these changes. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the point of view of Italian HR managers on the introduction of these new ways of working in Italian SMEs, to underline both the advantages and risks of remote work and to provide a shared list of best and worst practices related to remote work adoption. A Panel of 19 Italian experts of HR management was recruited in April 2022 to perform a Delphi study. They were asked to take part in an anonymous and asynchronous discussion started with stimulus questions, on their remote working experience during the pandemic. A mixed-methods approach was adopted for data collection and analysis. Results: Five principal themes emerged, related to both the positive and negative implications of the adoption of hybrid and remote work, namely: work-life balance, environmental sustainability, impact of working life on individual wellbeing and health, and technological improvement. The content analysis was realized with the use of the T-Lab software, stressing the risks of inaccurate planning and management of these new ways of work. Conclusions: This is the first application of a Delphi study in the Italian context on the impact of COVID-19 on work-life transformative processes. The results highlight the importance of clear communication, transparency, trust, and technology in successfully implementing remote and hybrid forms of work. By implementing these best practices, organizations can create a work environment that supports remote and hybrid work, fosters collaboration, and maintains productivity. The findings of this study can serve as a useful guide for organizations that are transitioning to remote or hybrid work models. © 2023 by the authors.},

In an endeavour to address this lacuna and enhance our comprehension, this study explicates how individuals engaging in UIC experience identity struggles and perform identity work by constructing and reconstructing their self-conception and the notion of what they can do. A single case study, of a research centre situated in Northern Europe with prolonged collaborative effort, was used as the methodological approach. The findings proffer insights into micro-foundations of UIC by outlining various ways individuals conduct identity work to navigate and bridge cognitive and behavioural boundaries. This knowledge disputes the prevailing view that UIC related identity tensions and struggles should be resolved at the organizational level. Instead, identity work is shown to be crucial in harnessing these struggles to support the knowledge exchange and creation, necessary for innovation. An emergent model of in-between identity work is generated demonstrating how individuals perform identity work at the intersection of organizational boundaries allowing them to embody both collective and individual identities, fostering belonging while preserving the cognitive and institutional variety. © 2024 The Author},

Despite initial positive indications, there is still a need for a deeper understanding of how organisational stakeholders play a role in implementing instructional gamification. This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach to identify and understand stakeholders’ instructional gamification design preferences and how these preferences might impact their endorsement of instructional gamification. A survey of 231 individuals at a software company was conducted to gather data on stakeholders’ preferences for instructional gamification. This was followed by in-depth interviews with eight employees to further enhance the understanding of stakeholders’ instructional gamification design preferences. The quantitative findings revealed four interrelated factors concerning the instructional gamification design preferences of the three stakeholder groups. However, the qualitative findings revealed that the stakeholder groups interpreted the items differently. By integrating the quantitative and qualitative findings, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors that enable or hinder stakeholders’ endorsement of instructional gamification in workplace learning. The study also presents four design propositions that facilitate stakeholder endorsement of gamified learning artifacts. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for designing and implementing instructional gamification in workplace learning environments. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In modern business conditions, entrepreneurship, as a significant driver of economic growth and development, is also an important facilitator of women's empowerment in developed and developing countries. Taking into account the significant contribution of female entrepreneurship to economic development and, on the other hand, its contribution to the empowerment of women, the paper examines the factors that influence the success of female entrepreneurs in the Republic of Serbia. The effects of many factors on the success of women entrepreneurs have been the subject of numerous studies, but this study focused on internal and external factors, which are still largely unexplored, particularly in the Republic of Serbia. In this sense, the aim of this work is to determine whether internal and external factors have direct, positive, and significant effects on women entrepreneurs' success. The specific research aims are: 1) determining whether internal factors have a positive effect on women entrepreneurs’ success and 2) determining whether external factors have a positive effect on women entrepreneurs’ success. The causal relationships between observed variables were assessed using the Structural Equation Modeling method. The obtained results showed that both internal and external factors are significant determinants of women entrepreneurs' success. The results emphasize the need to motivate women to start their own businesses by organizing various educational courses and workshops and women's support programs by the government. © 2023, Institute of Economic Sciences.

This study investigated the role of information and communication technology (ICT) tools in moderating the relationship between corporate culture (COC) and incubator success (INS) in Palestinian incubators. The use of ICT tools in a wide range of industries has facilitated the creation and growth of new enterprises, thereby improving competitiveness and market transparency. Correlations between factors in this study were investigated using a quantitative technique. COC, ICT, and INS factors. The survey questionnaire collected data from 96 participants in 23 incubators in Palestine. Seventy-nine respondents completed the survey. The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to examine the required models. The results showed that COC has a significant impact on INS in Palestine. In addition, ICT tools were found to moderate the relationship between COC and INS. This study provides practitioners with knowledge of one of the new and important factors that has an impact on INS in Palestine and highlight the importance of using ICT tools to enhance the relationship between INS and COC.

Research purpose: The main purpose of this article was to identify the factors influencing the experienced career success of Muslim women in the South African workplace. Motivation for the study: Numerous studies have focused on the factors influencing the career success of women in general; however, a paucity of research focuses on the factors influencing the experienced career success of Muslim women. This paper proposes the development of a framework to assist in the career advancement of Muslim women. Research approach/design and method: A quantitative descriptive and correlational research design was employed in this study using an online survey. Non-probability sampling methods were used, specifically, convenience and snowballing sampling. Data was collected from 243 respondents, including male and female across religion and occupation, but for this article, only the Muslim women cohort will be presented, n = 88. In addition, an exploratory factor analysis, descriptive analysis and Pearson moment correlations were used to analyse the data. Main findings: This study revealed that Organisational Success Strategies, Organisational Factors and Internal Factors influence the experienced success of Muslim women. Interestingly, Family and Social Factors showed no significance to the experienced success of Muslim women. Practical/managerial implications: Practical implications are twofold: (1) Muslim women are required to become active participants in their careers, and (2) organisations are required to provide an inclusive culture that supports the advancement of Muslim women. Contribution/value-add: This study contributes towards the body of knowledge specifically related to the career advancement and success of Muslim women in the South African context. © 2024.

As a result, we must reconstruct the meanings of workplace talent and TM to ensure business continuity in a disrupted workplace. Research purpose: The main objective of this research was to investigate the current thought processes and meanings associated with the concepts of talent and TM as catalysts for enhancing meaningful work experiences in a volatile workplace. Motivation for the study: Research exploring the meaning of talent and TM as a two-way approach in the new world of work is yet forthcoming. Research approach/design and method: A literature review was conducted to synthesise a shared comprehension of the meaning of talent and TM in the new work environment and their practical applications. Main findings: The findings reveal that the current definitions of talent and TM are ambiguous and contradictory. Consequently, there are numerous dichotomies regarding the most practical method of implementing TM during a crisis. From a multi-value perspective, talent provides valuable insights into how talent and TM practices can be optimised in a world of work characterised by disruption. Practical/managerial implications: Leaders and talent practitioners must reimagine and transform TM practices for sustainable and meaningful individual and organisational impact. Contribution/value-add: This paper provides novel and unique insights into how talent can best be optimised in the new world of work. © 2023. The Authors.},

	abstract = {The implementation of multi-space concepts in office buildings is a challenge for architects in early design phases. Activity-based work programmes require a user-specific demand analysis of the company based on employee profiles in order to be able to determine zone relationships, areas and other requirements. The multitude of factors results in complex demand programmes, which in turn, lead to difficulties in translating them into a design. The main objective of this paper is to reveal these difficulties for an essential parameter for efficient work, which is the interaction between employees within the company. This interaction is highly dependent on the spatial relation between the different zones in the building. A digital, grid-based model is used for quantifying zone relations in office building designs. The required zone connections are translated to the analysis model. For analysing zone connectivity, the parameters path length (metric shortest paths) and path complexity (visually shortest paths) are used. In this paper, we investigate two design projects for multi-space office buildings with 9300 m2 and 3600 m2. The results of the floor plan analysis are evaluated and compared to the demand requirements. Conspicuous deviations of the design from the demand are then discussed through expert interviews with the designing architects. The paper presents new findings on analysing path relationships in terms of the demand programme. It identifies factors that challenge the fulfilment of demanded zone connections, summarises the results and points out improvements to floor plan evaluation as well as optimisation potentials in the demand planning process. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We propose that additional research is needed to account for the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and multi-level factors that may influence a women entrepreneur’s decision to obtain financing including digital skills and women-focused resource groups. We outline a typology of attributes and subsequent impacts for how to obtain financing and extend the discussion of how the evolving entrepreneurial ecosystem include a multitude of financing alternatives.

This research also investigates some possible moderators (methodological, cultural, socio-economic and contextual) that could influence the direct effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study applied the meta-analysis approach to understand the effect of food shape abnormality on willingness to buy fruits and vegetables. In this research, 16 empirical articles were examined, with a total of 54 effect sizes. Findings: The results showed consistent negative effects between food shape abnormality and consumers’ willingness to buy fruits and vegetables. This study also found significant effects related to culture (Hofstede’s cultural dimensions) and to socio-economic (Human Development Index) moderators. The findings demonstrated that cultures with higher power distance levels promoted stronger effects in the relationship between abnormally shaped food and willingness to buy. Additionally, related to social–economy aspects of a nation, the negative effects between abnormally shaped food and willingness to buy are stronger in countries with low human development rates. Practical implications: Public policymakers can benefit from the main findings by implementing interventions strategies and education campaigns based on different cultural dimensions. In cultures characterized by high levels of aversion to uncertainty, social communication campaigns can build trust and provide the consumer more knowledge about abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables, whereas in cultures characterized by low levels of masculinity, related to higher levels of sustainability, local producers can benefit from the “local food” positioning to sell abnormally shaped fruits and vegetables. Originality/value: This research advances studies about consumer behaviour in relation to food waste, highlighting factors beyond aesthetic issues, such as a nation’s culture and its economic context. These results open the way for new work in this area. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To achieve this objective, a qualitative approach based on a case study was adopted. Portuguese HEIs cooperating in the Business Simulation (BS) project were analysed. The results obtained reveal that cooperation between HEIs, more specifically in the BS project, is fundamental for the exchange of knowledge, the acquisition of new technology and platforms, and the acquisition of new work practices. However, it will be necessary to overcome barriers, principally of a more technological nature. This study uses a new and innovative structure, employing a model that expands knowledge on the topic by identifying three dimensions that influence cooperation between HEIs.

In vocational education and training (VET), creativity is defined as problem-solving ability and ascribed to the transversal competences. Creativity is always context-dependent in terms of the work environment and specific demands of an occupation. To implement creativity didactically in the classroom and in the workplace, it is important to understand what creativity entails in the context of different occupations. Accordingly, the aim of this interview study was to conduct an initial investigation into the facets of creative potential in different occupations. Since a suitable instrument for measuring creativity does not exist in VET at time of writing, this study was based on theories and instruments used in psychology. The findings of this study show that in the four occupations studied (commercial clerk, specialist in care, IT specialist, and design engineer), different facets of creativity were relevant to successfully coping with creative situations. Overall, divergent and convergent thinking were identified as the most important facets of creativity in the professional creative situations examined. © 2021 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: As the pandemic begins to ease, many companies are figuring out that working remotely is the future of work and “a new normal”. This research focuses on strategic planning and practices inherent in remote work, and aims to identify the optimal balance between virtual and on-site working. Specifically, the authors investigate the moderating effects of managerial ability and Hofstede's cultural factors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a mathematical model to locate the optimal balance between virtual and on-site working. A numerical study is presented, and additional sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the proposed model. Findings: This model provides organizations with a general guideline with recommended optimal percentages of remote workforce based on specific Hofstede's national scores. The authors also find that organizations with varying levels of managerial ability exhibit different adoption rates of remote working. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the proposed model may lack empirical verification and require further adjustment of parameters. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to empirically and statistically test the proposed model further. Practical implications: This model equips organizations and practitioners with a general guideline to identify their desired portion of remote workforce. The incorporation of managerial ability and cultural factors makes our model applicable to various business structures across different sectors. Originality/value: This proposed model addresses this optimization problem from a mathematical perspective with an interdisciplinary approach. The model also considers the moderating effects of managerial ability and Hofstede's cultural factors. Highlights: The main contribution of this study is the theoretical development of our mathematical model that identifies the optimal balance between remote and on-site workforce in the context of managerial ability and Hofstede's cultural factors. A numerical study is presented, and additional sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the proposed model and highlight the moderating effect of managerial ability and cultural influence on the adopted percentages of remote working. Our study suggests that organizational capabilities, managerial skills, and culturally suitable work arrangement are vital in successful development and implementation of remote working policy. Practical managerial implications and general guidelines are offered to organizations and practitioners. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, sociologists of work have paid increasing attention to the critical phenomena in the labor market, among them the devaluation of work and its factors. Based on an analysis of publications in the field, this paper outlines problems of transforming work meanings and values, including their linkage with new worker risks and job security caused by the rapid work changes, precarization, social inequality, growing population gap between the advanced and developing countries, global pandemics, climate crisis and the like. These phenomena reflect social, economic, political, and legal changes and their impact on the sphere of work. Current work challenges have initiated research discussions in the work sphere that have helped spotlight the ongoing transformation of work meanings/values. The article reviews the diversity of theoretical approaches and practical implications of work values transformation from the perspective of factors determining long-lasting shifts in work values, ranging from recognizing the intrinsic meanings of work to the predominance of pragmatic, instrumental work attitudes. The authors identified three main types of transforming work values based on a systematic mapping of publications. First, the prevalence of material, pragmatic values almost does not leave space for the social value of work. Second, it is the perception of work as a meaningless activity that cannot contribute to work satisfaction. Third, it is a vision of a society without work. When describing these types, the authors outline the transformation of work into an ordinary market product that has lost its intrinsic value and become a source of frustration, alienation, and psychological stress for workers. Diversity of work values reflects the controversial processes related to the global transformation of labor from the growth of innovative potential of some professions to the fear of technological unemployment and new risks for others. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Business firms play an increasingly influential role in contemporary societies, which has led many scholars to return to the question of the democratisation of corporate governance. However, the possibility of democratic deliberation within firms has received only marginal attention in the current debate. This article fills this gap in the literature by making a normative case for democratic deliberation at the workplace and empirically assessing the deliberative capacity of self-organised teams within business firms. It is based on sixteen in-depth interviews in six German firms which practice various forms of self-organised teamwork. The article argues that self-organised teamwork can create a space for authentic, inclusive, and consequential deliberation by suspending authoritarian control structures within business firms. Finally, the article proposes the consideration of firms not only as necessary parts of a larger deliberative system but also as deliberative systems in themselves.  © The Author(s), 2021.

	abstract = {Technological advances have shown an accentuated growth trend, which is directly proportional to the quality of life in today’s society. As a result, the business market is becoming increasingly competitive and customers are becoming more demanding, forcing companies to look for new tools and adopt new work methodologies to improve their flexibility, effectiveness and efficiency, ensuring a better response to market needs. In this context, the tools for tracking objects, totally or partially automatic, are considered essential technologies to all kinds of analysis and the treatment of business data, providing several benefits to companies, including waste reduction, identification of bottlenecks, cost reduction, improvement of product quality and the entire flow of business information. A case study of an industrial company specializing in machining, polishing and galvanoplasty of metallic alloys, small size pieces to be incorporated in luxury fashion accessories, is presented. Derived from the difficulties underlying the implementation of a traceability system supported by identification technologies and obtaining data in an automatic way, the focus of the study is based on the identification of a base model, with sequential steps, which allows any industrial company to adapt these types of technological tools and systems. Based on the pillars of knowledge acquired through a bibliographic review on the subject, as well as on the recognition of the whole production flow, this work makes use of an implementation model already developed, studied and tested, supported by a project viability analysis measuring the benefits obtained with the results found after the respective implementation. Production performance increased with the implementation of a traceability system, as the time worked throughout the flow decreased. Production performance prior to implementation was around 98.6%. Applying a Kaizen (continuous improvement) strategy and based on the times collected in the pilot test, this indicator rose by 0.5%, obtaining a production performance of 99.1%, corresponding to an annual increase of 99 pieces. The integration of a robust and simple traceability system supported by automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technologies in this industrial environment allowed for automated data collection and processing. In addition to the financial and productive benefits, this Industry 4.0 implementation encompasses a huge medium- to long-term impact in functional and monitoring terms, providing enormous aid to the management of production flows. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Organizations in today's changing environment face significant challenges, requiring continual innovation. Understanding oneself from the employee's perspective is paramount, especially in organizations and businesses, transforming all levels, accommodating new work paradigms and adapting to the post-pandemic business world. The authors examine the employees' critical dimensions, self-concept and resilience through self-reported studies to ascertain the impact on their performance in the organization. Self-concept, a multidimensional knowledge structure, implies the individual's description and examination, including psychological characteristics, attributes and skills. On the other hand, resilience is adapting appropriately to adversity, challenges and stressful situations and emerging unscathed. Resilience additionally leads to profound personal growth and acceptance of reality. It also endows the individual's sense of identity over time. It provides insights into work behavior and outcomes and fosters a positive psychological perspective to improve performance. Job performance is an observable individual performance that adds value and enables organizational goal achievement. To sum job performance is an achievement-related behavior. The research study examines the relationship between employee self-concept, resilience and performance elements (task, contextual and counterproductive work behavior). Design/methodology/approach: Cross-sectional data were collected from 224 employees from the retail sector to test the hypotheses among self-concept, employee performance elements and resilience. SPSS 21.0 was used, and the authors conducted reliability, correlation and regression analysis using statistical tools to analyze the mediating effect. Findings: Self-concept and employee performance elements have significant relationships. The mediating effect of resilience on the relationship between self-concept and counterproductive work behavior and self-concept and contextual performance is significant. In contrast, resilience does not impact the relationship between self-concept and task performance. Originality/value: The authors examined a framework of untested variables, namely self-concept and the different factors of performance (task, contextual and counterproductive behavior). The authors investigated the mediating effect of resilience in the model, which was not previously explored. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In the contemporary global context, seafarers persist as the uncelebrated heroes of international trade, despite their substantial contributions. The current estimate places the number of STCW- certified officers at 857 540, reflecting a notable increase of 10.8% since 2015. Nevertheless, there is a growing recognition of the imperative to accord specific attention to seafarers’ mental and physical well-being. During their tenures aboard ships, seafarers confront various challenges, including psychological well-being, work-life imbalance, dissatisfaction, diminished performance, and a sense of mistrust toward the organizational framework. The primary objective of this research is to scrutinize the nexus between work-life balance and work effectiveness, exploring the mediating roles of psychological well-being, organizational happiness, and organizational trust. A questionnaire-based survey is meticulously crafted to achieve this, employing a dataset comprising 420 seafarers engaged in diverse vessel types in Turkey, operating under both Turkish and international flags. Methodologically, structural equation modeling and correlation analyses are executed to assess the formulated research hypotheses rigorously. The empirical findings of this research reveal noteworthy mediating roles: psychological well-being exhibits a complete mediation effect, organizational happiness demonstrates a full mediation effect, and organizational trust manifests a partial mediation effect. These outcomes underscore the nuanced interplay between work-life balance and work effectiveness in the seafaring context. The implications of these findings extend significantly to the maritime sector and industry, accentuating the imperative for targeted interventions to enhance the well-being and performance of seafaring professionals. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The study respondents were employees with a remote working status in Serbian companies, and a total of 226 valid surveys were collected. The PLS-SEM approach was deployed to test the hypothesized relationship between named variables. A standard bootstrapping procedure was used to reveal direct and indirect effects among latent variables. Results indicate a strong and positive direct association between social support and work engagement and job performance, while mediation and moderation of the role of social support were mostly confirmed but with some results opposite to what was expected. Social support was not able to buffer a negative home–work interaction and loneliness within remote working. The study offers insight into the role of social support and recommendations for managing the antecedents and consequences of remote working, with the aim to determine a sustainable model for extensive application, not only during the COVID-19 pandemic, but in regular times. © 2021 by the authors.

This study, therefore, seeks to explain the perplexing relationship between organizational goal ambiguity (OGA) and innovative work behavior (IWB) regarding the mediating effect of employee morale. A survey was administered, and respondents were selected from four public organizations of Iran. Finally, data were collected from 700 operational, full-time employees. Results indicated that employee morale mediates the connection between OGA and IWB.

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a questionnaire survey method to collect the expert responses for a knowledge management framework which is suggested in the literature for software development work. The questionnaire survey findings were verified by expert interviews. Findings: The research shows that there is a lot of similarity between re-engineering and maintenance projects for different kinds of business knowledge expertise requirements for execution. The development projects require higher expertise in all the business knowledge for execution. Research limitations/implications: The research work studies the business knowledge required for the execution of development, re-engineering and maintenance projects in Indian outsourcing software projects. However, the project’s characteristics can vary drastically for a single kind of project. So the study cannot be generalized and instead should be used as a tool for learning. Practical implications: The research findings can be used by software project managers to get insight into project planning, which can help the division of work between the onsite, offshore team and individual work allocation. Originality/value: The research is novel as there are very few previous attempts to find the business expertise needed to execute various kinds of software projects in the Indian outsourcing industry. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Mega Trends like E-Mobility, Internet of Things, Zero-Badge Production as well as alternative mobility solutions as car sharing are shaking up the automotive industry. The manufacturing process has to adapt to technological changes as well as to social trends. Hence, the production is undergoing fundamental changes and is increasingly demanding for adaptivity. New machines, prototypes and new ways of human-machine interaction are consequently finding their way to the shop floor, allowing more complex and flexible manufacturing. This increasing complexity of production calls for a skilled workforce. To enable production workers to strive in this new work environment training is ever more relevant. The workforce needs to be flexible and agile to account for the new adaptive production processes. Technical knowledge regarding current mobility trends as well practical knowledge in the context of operating new machines has to be acquired continuously to keep up with the fast-paced environment. The organizational learning infrastructure is hereby determining the possible knowledge generation and transfer within the shop floor. In this context digital learning has to offer great potential to adjust the corporate learning infrastructure to account for the current challenges. Although digital learning receives evermore attention, digital learning for production work is widely underrepresented in current research. The objective of this paper is therefore to add on the understanding of digital learning in the industrial setting. For this reason, the current work setting of production workers in the automotive industry is explored and potential success factors of a digital learning infrastructure are assessed with the aid of workshops, multi-perspectives interviews and a subsequent questionnaire-based survey. The qualitative findings suggest huge potentials of digital media regarding formal and informal learning in the work place, whereas the first quantitative results suggest causal relationships between the quality of learning and the digitalization of learning.This paper subsequently elaborates on the qualitative and quantitative results regarding a framework of digital learning in production work and the importance of organizational factors determining the success of individual digital solutions. It is a first contribution in actively shaping a digital learning infrastructure in the automotive sector to enable continuous knowledge management in production. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Compared with prior bibliometric studies in the field, we examined a larger data sample, analysed the most recent publications, and identified the latest research fronts. Conclusively, we illustrated in a flowchart the evolution of the TIM landscape during five three-year periods. In this article, we describe in detail six latest research fronts and their evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the thematic differences of TIM specialty journals in contrast to strategic management journals. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This study explores how entrepreneurs modify their financial path(s) and go beyond job security to attain greater financial freedom. The present work examines the cash-flow quadrant (CFQ) attributes and demonstrates the importance of the push-pull factors for an individual’s quadrant transition in achieving financial freedom. Design/methodology/approach - A hypothetical model and an abductive approach were used through regression models in a population sample of 260 Bahraini entrepreneurs. Fuzzy participatory cognitive mapping was also used to develop a conceptual model of financial path transition’s decision making among entrepreneurs and study the impact of certain push-pull factors on the entrepreneurs’ decisions. Findings - The triangulated study identifies six categories of variables: financial freedom, workplace condition, independence, salary level, family life-building and retirement savings as key pull-push factors that significantly impact financial path transition’s decision. Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) extends our knowledge of the dynamics of CFQ transitions from a push-pull factor perspective. The results indicate no significant differences between the variables listed in the regression model and the fuzzy cognitive map model. Four categories of pull-push factors appeared as the entrepreneurs’ top rankings when ordered by complexity, centrality scores and impact weight. These categories were workplace conditions, financial freedom, independence and salary level. The findings widen the scope of knowledge of each quadrant and rationalize how and why such factors impact quadrant decisions among Bahraini entrepreneurs. Originality/value - Many studies discuss the CFQ model and consider its quadrants a specific method for identifying a unique financial path to generate income. A shifting quadrant occurs when individuals want to change their financial path and move beyond job security to achieve more financial freedom. Although this transition is well-established in the literature, the factors accounting for the individual’s transition across quadrants have not received enough attention. This study fills this gap and calls for more in-depth investigations of this area to better understand the dynamics of CFQ transitions from a push-pull factor perspective. © 2021, World Association for Sustainable Development.

We apply a case study methodology to capture the richness of community-based entrepreneurship and evidence the diversity of these initiatives. By presenting and analyzing three case studies on different types of environmentally-driven initiatives – considering the natural environment as an object, context or resource of entrepreneurial activities, we identify the main elements of community entrepreneurship and the factors influencing its manifestations. These elements are integrated into a synthetic model, which maps the relationships between various components and success factors of environmentally-driven community initiatives.

	abstract = {Demands for high-speed wireless data services grow rapidly. It is a big challenge to increasing the network capacity operating on licensed spectrum resources. Unlicensed spectrum cellular networks have been proposed as a solution in response to severe spectrum shortage. Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) was standardized by 3GPP, aiming to deliver data services through unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum. Furthermore, the 3GPP proposed 5G New Radio-Unlicensed (NR-U) study item. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted enormous attention to implement 5G and beyond systems, which is known as Intelligent Radio (IR). To tackle the challenges of unlicensed spectrum networks in 4G/5G/B5G systems, a lot of works have been done, focusing on using Machine Learning (ML) to support resource allocation in LTE-LAA/NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence environments. Generally speaking, ML techniques are used in IR based on statistical models established for solving specific optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent research efforts related to unlicensed cellular networks and IR technologies, which work jointly to implement 5G and beyond wireless networks. Furthermore, we introduce a positioning assisted LTE-LAA system based on the difference in received signal strength (DRSS) to allocate resources among UEs. We will also discuss some open issues and challenges for future research on the IR applications in unlicensed cellular networks.  © 2021 KSII.},

	abstract = {Today, many hospitals seek to adopt the latest and most sophisticated technologies in order to raise the service quality and users’ satisfaction. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) had a substantial impact on the health sector and has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare providers. The purpose of this research is to examine the factors that affect users’ satisfaction with the current Health Record System in the Kingdom of Bahrain. A research model was built based on three popular models of users’ satisfaction toward information systems. Toward achieving the research objective, a quantitative approach was followed to collect data from an online survey. Accordingly, 152 responses were collected from the users of EHR in public hospitals and health centres in Bahrain. The results of the survey were analyzed using SPSS and SmartPLS 3.0. It was concluded that the most effective factors in the users’ satisfaction with EHR were directly service quality and technical support, with system and information quality indirectly through trust. © 2019 by IGI Global.},

	abstract = {The interaction takes place in a context that is rapidly transforming. New forms of care provision are emerging through technology and digitalization. This may involve predictive care, but also clients who organize themselves via, for example, a platform in order to gain more influence on the care process. This is about the connection between technological innovation and social innovation. Technological innovation has various components: Home, Garden and Kitchen Technology, but also the application possibilities of artificial intelligence. Social innovation is reflected in, for example, healthcare cooperatives. Social innovation is expressed in various ways to achieve more autonomy. An important part is that clients have access to their own health information. In terms of policy, it is about interpreting demand-driven management: the organization of care on the basis of an equal position between client and care professional, whereby the client has the relevant health information available. Interacting with each other in a certain way creates a form of life however, it can also be interpreted differently. For both, it is about finding meaning in which the unequal roles lead to equal people. Important elements are: understanding of each other's position, reflection on the own position, provision of information that matches the client's wishes and approach of the care professional, information provision that meets the needs of informal caregivers, funding model that facilitates equivalence and space for professionals to handle variety (innovation of regulatory space). © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Findings: Findings showed that team EI is positively associated with team performance. In addition, trust and conflict in the team mediate the association between team EI and team performance. Practical implications: The ability to perceive one’s own and others’ emotions significantly increases the likelihood of team performance by increasing trust in a team and reducing conflict. Therefore, managers can use these findings to boost team performance and reduce conflict in their teams.

	abstract = {The world is evolving, and it has transformed from the industrial age to the era of connected and intelligent products in both organizations and competition. The advances in technology in the last decade have led to the introduction of a new term called Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution and that has led to the emergence of the term Quality 4.0. Quality 4.0 is the digitalization of traditional quality approaches and the focus on the use of digital tools to improve an organization’s ability to meet customers’ requirements with high quality. The purpose of this paper is to assess the environments of higher education institutions (HEIs) against the 11 axes of LNS Research Quality 4.0 framework and provide insights about their readiness for Quality 4.0 transformation. The framework helps the organizations digitalize their traditional quality practices and transform to Quality 4.0 through exploring the traditional quality—Quality 4.0 continuum of tools and/or concepts related to each axis so they can assess their transformation efforts accordingly. This paper uses these continuums to identify the quality implementation efforts conducted by HEIs through analyzing the continuums’ related practices adopted within their environments and find out what should be done to get to the full transformation to Quality 4.0 within the higher education field. The study shows the HEIs potential of adopting the Quality 4.0 tools and techniques of varies axes of the framework while revealing a limited adoption of most of them in the current times. This is due to several challenges the most impacting of which is having fragmented processes together with fragmented data systems and sources. The study is concluded with a proposed roadmap to assist HEIs to get the best out their efforts in the Quality 4.0 transformation process. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Change Management can be defined as the sum of tasks, measures and activities that are intended to bring about a comprehensive, cross-departmental and far-reaching change in an enterprise or organization. Change Management includes the implementation of new a mission, vision, strategies, structures, systems, processes and behaviours in an organization. The ultimate goal of change is to obtain a long-term favourable position in the market and to gain a sustainable competitive advantage (Helmold, 2020). Synonyms for Change management found in literature are Business Process Reengineering, Turnaround Management, Transformation Management, Lean Management, Innovation Management or Total Quality Management (Vahs, 2019). Change is increasingly determining the everyday businesses and activities of companies. In order to manage change in the most optimal way, special change management techniques are required, which can be summarized under the term Change Management (Lauer, 2019, 2020). The human factor is at the forefront of all considerations, because the implementation of change depends on the active support of employees. Since everyone has their own needs, ideas and experiences, some of which do not conform to the official company organization, there can be no simple recipe for how to successfully manage change. Rather, it is a complex process, that has to start at three points: the organization and individuals concerned, the corporate structures and the corporate culture (Lauer, 2019). Another important element in the context is the technological factor including systems, routines, methods and instruments (Helmold & Samara, 2019). Figure 3.1 summarizes the elements of change management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

After an explorative qualitative empirical work; we summarize learnings from these successes and present them as a backdrop for future studies. The main value of this study is in the discovery of the importance of technical and process readiness with an emphasis on dedicated stakeholder engagement to guarantee the successful outcome. The focus on the patient journey and the wellbeing of the practitioner in the new digital ecosystem are as important as financial preparation and infrastructure readiness. Researchers are still pondering the unintended consequences of EMR implementations and the effect of such implementations on the stakeholders of the healthcare ecosystem. In this paper, we argue that the road to success in the implementation of eHealth must be through stakeholder engagement as a means to increase the satisfaction of practitioners with the new work environment.

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death, morbidity, and health-care spending. The Halifax, Nova Scotia-based INSPIRED COPD Outreach Program™ has proved highly beneficial for patients and the health-care system. With direct investment of <$1-million CAD, a pan-Canadian quality improvement collaborative (QIC) supported the spread of INSPIRED to 19 teams in the 10 Canadian provinces contingent upon participation in evaluation. The collaborative evaluation followed a mixed-methods summative approach relying on collated quantitative data, team documents, and surveys sent to core members of the 19 teams. Survey questions included a series of multiple-choice responses, Likert scale ratings, and open-ended questions. The qualitative evaluation entailed key informant interviews and focus groups undertaken between February and April 2016 post-collaborative. Teams reported that the year-long QIC helped bring focus to a needed, though often overlooked area of improvement, facilitating innovation spread. They report examples of new work practices as well as unanticipated cultural change (given the short QIC time frame). Most teams gained new skills in quality improvement (QI) and evidence-based medicine, showing progress in their ability to measure and implement COPD care improvements. Teams felt networking with other teams across the country toward a common solution as well as learning from a team of clinical innovators and evidence-based innovation were critical to their success. Factors affecting sustainability included local leadership support, involvement of frontline clinicians, and sharing milestones to motivate continued QI. The INSPIRED QIC enabled teams across Canada to adapt and implement a new COPD care model for high users of health-care with rapid improvements to work practices, cultural change, and skill sets, and at relatively low cost. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Design/methodology/approach: A survey with a Web-based questionnaire was designed and used in a Swedish health-care organization two years after the initiation of Lean to investigate the managers’ views on their role, conditions and ability to create change according to Lean. The result from two of the questions will be presented where one focuses on the relationship to the first-line managers’ own manager and the second on the relationship to their coworkers. Findings: The results show that to initiate improvement, work based on Lean first-line managers ask for own managers who are assured about Lean, include them in discussions and ask for follow-ups and results about Lean. Concerning first-line managers’ relation to their coworkers they experience themselves as responsible for leading toward creating a culture where problems and mistakes are viewed as possibilities to improve, for encouraging that new work procedures are tested and for creating commitment and inspiration in relation to their coworkers. Originality/value: The questions can be used separately or as part of an entire questionnaire before and along the Lean process to highlight organizational issues such as shared responsibility and supportive relations when developing health care. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

An analysis of data collected from 341 project team members in large-scale construction projects showed that construction project workers with higher emotional intelligence exhibit higher satisfaction, greater commitment towards their job, and lower turnover intentions. Additionally, role ambiguity acts to weaken the positive association between team satisfaction and performance.

	abstract = {The Cash-flow quadrant (CFQ) is increasingly recognized as an important concept that explains the movement of money and illustrates the different ways of generating income. Although CFQ is well-established in the literature regarding the combination of four specific methods for identifying unique financial paths (Employees (E); Small business owner (S); Big business owner (B) and Investor (I)) to generate income, the factors contributing to the transition from one quadrant to another are rather neglected. Specifically, the way in which specific skills, particular ways of thinking, different levels of education and personalities contributing dynamically to financial path transfer has not received enough attention. To fill this gap, we examined how entrepreneurs change their financial path (s) and go beyond job security to achieve greater financial freedom. Our study examines the attributes of the Cash-flow quadrant and shows how much the push-pull factors are of great importance for the Cash-Flow Quadrant transition in achieving financial freedom. Our research synthesizes the literature on push-pull factors including Financial Freedom (FF), workplace condition (WC), Independency (ID), Salary level (SL), Family Life-building (FL) and Saving for Retirement (SR) and extends knowledge on the dynamic CFQ transitions from a push-pull factor-based perspective. The obtained information regarding switching quadrant decisions would be useful for those seeking a new financial path and wish to take appropriate measures to preserve their financial freedom and legacy. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

Nevertheless, too few companies have reacted to the demographic change and introduced health-promoting measures. This paper aims to identify which factors influence the implementation of WHP, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in rural areas. Design/methodology/approach: 253 companies in a rural area in the federal state of Saxony (Germany) were surveyed using a standardised questionnaire via a computer-assisted telephone interview. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were carried out. The focus was on the relationship between the status of WHP and the size of the company, pressure of demographic change, health-related attitude and organisational capacity factors. Findings: It was shown that, in addition to the control variables company size and pressure of the shortage of skilled workers, a company's attitude regarding health promotion, financial capacity and planning and development capacity has a relevant influence on the status of WHP. Practical implications: Based on the results, targeted measures can be developed and converted to implement WHP, particularly in SMEs in rural regions. The focus should be on sensitisation, knowledge transfer and capacity development.

In response, many companies have adopted enterprise social networks (ESN) as alternative communication channels, though surprisingly little research attention focuses on the articulation process by which both technologies influence work practices, through complementarity or substitution effects, or addresses the information overload challenge. In this article, we detail an empirical, qualitative study of the articulations of emails, ESN, and other collaborative tools in organizations, on the basis of 1) an exploratory study of three companies from various sectors, 2) an auto-ethnography that relies on participant observations from a large French telecommunication company, and 3) a validation through in-depth discussions with experts. The resulting causal framework of the articulations of usage factors of email, ESN, and specialized collaborative tools at work contains three main contributions. First, we enhance understanding of information overload by clarifying that it is not intrinsic to email and by analyzing the emerging notion of "collaborative overload. " Second, we determine that ESN may not be the solution for fostering new behaviors. Third, workplaces do not need ESN tooling but rather require a digital transformation strategy, with more emphasis on meeting employees' needs instead of focusing solely on an ESN's promise for altering workplace culture and practices. © IAE School of Management Montpellier University.},

Knowledge management (KM) is widely considered an essential antecedent of innovation. However, very little empirical research has specifically addressed how KM is nurtured as support for innovation from a behavioral point of view. This paper aims to operationalize the characteristics of a fitting context – in terms of top management support, organizational rewards and mutual trust – and to clarify the role of organizational context on knowledge management strategies (KMS) and ultimately on firm innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: By studying 98 surveys from 23 companies from Technology Fast 50 list, based on using the partial least squares method, the authors find that this organizational context has a significant impact on the formulation and implementation of KMS. Findings: Organizational/behavioral context has significant effects on the formulation and implementation of KMS as well as firm innovativeness. The results also demonstrate that the tacit KMS has a crucial impact on firm innovativeness. Originality/value: From a behavioral perspective, this study empirically examines the role of organizational context (top management support, organizational rewards and mutual trust), KMS and firm innovativeness in a holistic manner in Turkey, a developing country. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no researcher has undergone those relationships in literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study examines the mediating role of supervisory trust between the relationship of supervisory justice & perceived supervisor support and organizational citizenship behavior & commitment to supervisor. Drawing on social exchange theory and justice theory, we hypothesize that supervisory justice and perceived supervisor support will significantly affect trust in supervisor which in turn enhances subordinate organizational citizenship behavior and commitment to supervisor. Data was collected from 350 employees of telecommunication sector of Pakistan through a self-administered survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was applied via LISERL to test the hypothesized model. The results revealed that supervisory justice (interpersonal, and informational justice) and perceived supervisor support are positively and significantly related to organizational citizenship behavior and commitment to supervisor except for supervisory procedural justice. Moreover, trust in supervisor partially mediates the relationship between supervisory justice (interpersonal, and informational justice) & perceived supervisor support and organizational citizenship behavior & commitment to supervisor. However, the mediation of supervisory trust was not supported for supervisory procedural justice and organizational citizenship behavior & commitment to supervisor. Based on the results, theoretical, practical implications, and future research directions are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Developers encounter numerous obstacles in their efforts to successfully complete activities, such as the need to develop software within highly-complex broad-ranging projects. These problems increase levels of stress, which subsequently affect developers’ ability to self-regulate their feelings and understanding. However, only scant attention has been paid to their personal skills and competency in overcoming these issues. This study therefore aimed to bridge this gap by exploring the impact of developers’ emotional intelligence on stress, trust, and performance. Our empirical results show that emotional intelligence mitigates stress and fosters trust among software developers working on information system projects. Additionally, role ambiguity increases the effect of stress on performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Strategic decision-making still struggles to cope with the interference of people in its proposed plans, creating a gap between idealised and real-world versions. Even when the existence of humans is considered, models and abstractions tend to be simplistic and lacking in complex human traits (e. g. creativity, sentiment). We analyse the current scientific landscape in the dimensions that overlap in the field of strategic decision making and posit that to provide means to a more informed and robust decision-making, humans should not only be seen as elements that need to accept and adopt decisions, but also as actors that affect their outcomes. Humans should be understood as central pieces and the strategic decision-making process should thus consider their importance both in techniques that foster co-creation, and also in developing dynamic models that demonstrate their influence and impact. In this article, we describe this problem-space and outline an approach integrating Decision Intelligence, Enterprise Architecture, Design Thinking, and architectural principles to achieve a human-centric, adaptive strategic design. We also discuss the influence of information presentation and visuals for meaningful participation in strategic decision-making processes. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

We used a hybrid similarity measure combining bibliographic coupling and textual information to create bibliometric networks and to cluster the literature on TIM. Compared with prior bibliometric studies in the field, we examined a larger data sample, analysed the most recent publications, and identified the latest research fronts. Conclusively, we illustrated in a flowchart the evolution of the TIM landscape during five three-year periods. In this article, we describe in detail six latest research fronts and their evolution. Furthermore, we discuss the thematic differences of TIM specialty journals in contrast to strategic management journals. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

This study also determined the direct and indirect impacts of these variables on organizational functionality in general and drawing lessons to educational organizations in specific. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative study. Data from 185 participants were analyzed using SPSS software version 24. The data analysis procedure for this study followed various steps. First, multiple factor analysis was conducted to narrow the long list of items and to create a manageable list of construct variables for analyses. Then path analysis, using a series of multiple regression, was conducted to identify the degree of relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Finally, a path model coefficient diagram was created. Findings: Using path analysis, a new model that depicts the level of interactions among the proposed variables and the extent and direction of influence of each variable on organizational level of functionality has been created. In addition, a path diagram that illustrates the model is provided and explained. This study also determined the direct and indirect impacts of these variables on organizational functionality. Finally, conclusions and implications of the study for educational organizations were presented. Research limitations/implications: It should be noted that path analysis studies, by nature, are based on assumptions provided by the researchers. Hence, future studies using different variables and different assumption may not necessarily generate the same result. In addition, this study looked at a broader view of organizations rather than a specific type. Practical implications: This study expanded the use of organizational diagnosis frameworks, beyond studying organizational performance, to study organizational level of functionality which can be used to diagnose the level of function (or dysfunction) of organizations in a holistic manner. Social implications: The present study contributes to the body of literature in organizational diagnosis in various ways; chief of which is the creation of a new path model which shows the direct and indirect effects of specific variables in numeric terms. Originality/value: Unlike previous studies on the topic, this study suggests that organizational level of functionality should be studied using variables internal to the organization, because any two organizations of similar purpose and capacity, located in similar environment, could function differently due to factors internal to the organizations. Investigating organizational level of functionality using variables internal to the organization is assumed to provide a deeper diagnosis and self-assessment as it minimizes the noises created by variables external to the organization. All the variables in this study are therefore carefully selected to be internal to organizations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Although information systems provide many benefits to the organization, many organizations are experiencing difficulties with the process of change. Resistance to change is one of the most considerable challenges in this phase. This study aimed to investigate the causes of resistance by healthcare personnel to IT in Adana Numune Hastanesi, which is a state-run hospital located in Adana, Turkey. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was expanded by adding factors such as affective commitment, gender, and age. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on the research model through 291 collected survey data using SPSS (version 21). The overall percentage accuracy prediction was 55.3% for parameters of the initial model and 80.8% for the stepwise model after the third step. According to the results, while the factors “perceived usefulness of IT,” “perceived ease of use of IT,” and “affective commitment” were found to have an influence on the resistance of use of IT, demographic factors such as age, gender, position, and tenure were not related. Managers should create an environment for increasing staff commitment by including them in decision-making and process changing. Thus, not only could the manager use the organizations’ resources productively, but also future change projects could be carried out effectively, roughly, and timely. Therefore, through its committed personnel, the hospital could sustainably compete with its competitors in the market and make more profit. © 2020, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

Deploying a research instrument used in a study in 2009, we compare and contrast the views of practitioners and clients both with updated data and over time. We find once again that systematic differences in the perceptions of professional-client relationship quality exist. We find that these perceptions have changed over time, with high-wealth clients’ perceptions differing from those of other clients, just as the perceptions of more highly educated financial advisers differ from those of advisers with less education.

It brings together the results of a survey conducted simultaneously in a number of countries, with the express intention of building up understanding of how companies throughout the world are managing the process of implementing and, perhaps more importantly, sustaining, the process of CI. In so doing, the book offers a perspective on the similarities and differences of experience in a number of countries and sheds light on possible generic problems that managers throughout the world will have to grapple with if they are to take advantage of the true potential offered by their significant investments in human resources. © Harry Boer, Anders Berger, Ross Chapman and Frank Gertsen 2000.

However, this has been discussed exclusively in chapters and books as separate propositions. It is essential to understand the two as linked together, building upon the other, merging individual and organizational perspectives of competencies development. Building Competencies for Organizational Success: Emerging Research and Opportunities presents a narrowly focused discussion of competency-based approaches and performance management and examines how these concepts align with business processes and procedures, management systems, and business objectives. It brings to light a new era of business performance management that complements the collaborative working of individuals and organizations to achieve business desires and addresses such topics as competent organization, knowledge management, and performance management systems. This book helps leaders, managers, executives, consultants, practitioners, academicians, researchers, and students with the understanding of how to utilize intellectual assets as well as how to develop a better future and outcomes for business and people management. © 2021 by IGI Global.

It signifies the importance of developing competency-based performance concept in organizations. Since conventional performance management systems (PMSs) are diminishing and as organizations are looking for breakthrough PMSs, this research attempted to fill the gap from stakeholder’s perspective – employee, manager and organization in devising new approach in PMS. Design/methodology/approach: The research design involved developing scale for “competency-based superior performance” and validating scale for “organizational effectiveness,” The data for this survey are collected from 292 respondents through structured questionnaire. Hypotheses depicting aforementioned relationships were empirically tested in the context of competency-based performance practices in organizations based in India. Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used for data analysis. Findings: The empirical results provide methods to accelerate the performance management initiatives based on a leadership competency model (LCM), which are necessary for building performance culture in the organization. The paper contributes by developing a new scale for measuring competency-based performance practices. The scale for OE is revisited. A positive relationship between competency-based superior performance and OE with productivity, adaptability and flexibility has been empirically confirmed using SEM. Research limitations/implications: The paper limits the performance measurement concept using leadership competencies. Practical implications: The developed model will act as a building block for performance measurement in organizations. This paper promotes LCM to be applied in creating a performance-based culture. Originality/value: This is a unique attempt to test the relationship between competency-based performance management and OE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The model of this research paper is tested using a sample of 300 employees occupying the position of officer grade I, II and III in conventional banking sector of Bahawalpur. Researchers have used the simple random sampling technique for the collection of data with the help of questionnaire. SPSS version 21 is used to analyze data collected for this research paper. The result shows that out of nine factors, seven factors namely individual personality, individual attitude, reward and recognition, competence based trust, benevolence based trust, ICT infrastructure and availability and ICT know how are all significantly and positively related with the innovation capabilities as well as knowledge sharing and thus knowledge sharing also mediates between them. But the two factors centralization and formalization have an insignificant relationship with the innovation capabilities and knowledge sharing. Hence, no mediation takes place between them. Moderator; organizational learning also plays a significant role between knowledge sharing and innovation capabilities.

However, how the relationships among these three variables influence project performance remains unclear. Complementing and extending prior research, this study uncovers how leader-leader exchange and trust affect the relationship between goal orientations and project performance. A cross-sectional analysis of 320 auditing project managers from 50 financial service companies shows that leader-leader exchange and trust mediate how goal orientations influence project performance. We also find that trust further moderates the effect of leader-leader exchange on project performance. Subsequent quantitative analysis of structural equation modeling reveals that leader-leader exchange has the largest direct effect on project performance; team-mastery goal orientation has the second-largest direct effect but the largest total effect.

In a diverse climate, team members have different thinking capacities, knowledge, perspectives, and strategies that help to create new ideas. But sometimes, this diversity causes conflicts among the team members, ultimately creating tension, resentment, and loathing behavior at the workplace. Therefore, the current study attempts to understand the relationship between team diversity (knowledge, value) and project performance through trust and absorptive capacity. Data were collected from team members involved in IT (Information Technology) projects. Findings reveal that team diversity enhances project performance through trust and absorptive capacity. But the relationship is partially mediated in the case of value diversity and fully mediated with knowledge diversity.

Knowledge management (KM) is an enabler to support collaboration efforts. The SCM and KM areas have largely focused on improving organisational performance. While the latter has yielded successful outcomes in different sectors, there is still a scarcity of research on identifying influential factors highlighting those aspects which may enable green supply chain collaboration (GrSCC), thus leading to sustainable energy futures and carbon-efficient production. This paper examines the role of KM in facilitating GrSCC. Through the identification of key factors extrapolated from the literature, a model for implementing GrSCC using a futures-based perspective is proposed. This paper inductively demonstrates the relationship between identified GrSCC factors through fuzzy cognitive mapping technique. Findings support a futures-based perspective that enhances understanding and refines forward-looking strategies for GrSCC. © 2017 The Author(s).

Now some contemplate long-term, also permanent WFH for select employee segments even post-pandemic, for productivity benefits. But employee wellbeing is critical for productivity. Therefore, this article examines effects of personal and job-related factors on wellbeing for 301 Indian employees placed under WFH during COVID lockdown of early-2020 and longer. Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that demographically, the presence of elders at home and employment in manufacturing were negatively associated with wellbeing. Among personal attributes, the need for structure (routines) was negatively associated with wellbeing. But the need for autonomy (volition) and job crafting to increase structural job resources (proactively obtaining more responsibility and knowledge) were positively associated with wellbeing. Wellbeing was also positively associated with job-related factors of technology and supervisor support. These findings could inform customization of, and interventions under, organisations’ WFH approaches. © 2022 Management Development Institute.},

	abstract = {Maintaining a skilled, knowledgeable and adaptable workforce in Australian rangeland enterprises and research, development and extension/adoption (RD&E/A) organisations is a varied and challenging task, compounded by trends of sustained losses of human capacity through senior retirements and short-term appointments over the last decade. Concerns for how to fill these gaps while gaining the skills and knowledge needed for a successful career and leadership roles were raised by students and young professionals in the World Cafe session and throughout Early Career workshops and activities at the 2019 Biennial Conference of the Australian Rangeland Society (ARS). This paper responds to these expressed information needs through drawing on literature, experiences shared by session participants, and existing ARS members currently working in the rangelands in diverse roles to provide insights into two main areas: (i) skills and knowledge for personal development and future success in the rangelands across three broad classes of occupation/careers (i.e. advisors, researchers, and producers), and (ii) skills and knowledge that will be expected of future leaders in the rangelands. We outline a variety of options for professional development in the early stage(s) of a career working on aspects of sustainable production systems and pathways to leadership throughout a career in the rangelands. We note the apparent lack of formal rangeland-specific education in Australia, and suggest that this is a major impediment to efforts to build skills and knowledge to ensure the viability of the livelihoods and the integrity of our rangelands. Finally, we believe that the ARS has the potential to play a more central role in inspiring interest and passion for the rangelands, in providing current information on (i) range science and management-relevant education and training opportunities in Australia and internationally, and (ii) leadership development and training opportunities and in facilitating and supporting mentoring to develop and retain human capacity for a resilient future.  © 2020 Journal Compilation },

	abstract = {Purpose: Many organizations in Hong Kong have witnessed a reduction in average space usage due to high occupancy costs. New working practices (NWPs) are viewed as a reform tool to manage expensive real estate around the world. However, it is unclear whether NWPs influence office space usage in business organizations in Hong Kong. This study, therefore, aims to evaluate if the average space reduction in office firms is caused by the NWPs in the finance, insurance, real estate and business (FIREB) firms. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 20 NWPs were initially derived from the extant literature. A questionnaire survey was conducted with listed FIREB firms in Hong Kong to assess the impact of the identified NWPs on space usage. The data collected from the questionnaire survey were analysed using descriptive, explorative factor analysis (EFA) and partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate the effects of NWPs on average space usage. Findings: Results revealed that four major NWP factors influence average space usage. Three of these factors, namely, “flexible arrangement”, “multitasking knowledge workers” and “teamwork and communication”, influence space usage positively. Even though the effect of the fourth factor “training and networking” was significant, it does not reflect a positive influence on space usage. Business organizations can focus more on the implementation of NWPs to cushion the effects of the high cost of occupancy. Originality/value: The research provides new knowledge to the limited literature on the effect of NWPs in FIREB firms and enriches the growing body of international literature on how today’s competitive global business organizations should revisit their workplace strategies to accommodate the rising agile workforce and NWPs. The findings offer new insights into the ongoing debate on the impact of information and communication technology-enabled NWPs on space usage. From the real estate perspective, the findings should inform policymaking towards the better planning ahead of office properties to accommodate NWPs, helping Hong Kong to remain competitive as a key financial centre. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Rather than relying on the CEO's personal influence, AL centers on structuring and operating core organization-wide processes that diffuse leadership influence across managerial levels and harness the whole organization better to attain its goals. AL is grounded in the academic management literature. It complements theories that focus on targets but neglect the means needed to achieve them. Though most managers spend much of their time dealing with the means while struggling with insufficient infrastructure, existing management theories ignore these issues or say little about them. Architectural leadership theory provides a solution to this lacuna. Applying AL can help managers create value by developing the infrastructure required for strategy implementation. © 2017 European Academy of Management},

The research follows the trail of development practitioners and researchers who travel with a desire to help, teach and study the local hosts. On a broader level, it is a journey exploring how the conditions of hospitality become negotiated between these actors. The theoretical approach bases itself on the ethical subjectivity as responsibility and receptivity towards 'the other'. The ideas put forward in the book suggest that hospitality, responsibility and participation all require a readiness to interrupt one's own ways of doing, knowing and being. This book provides a conceptual tool to facilitate reflection on alternative ways of doing togetherness and will be of interest to students and researchers of hospitality, tourism, development studies, cultural studies and anthropology. © 2018 Emily Höckert.

This is the initial step of a research project which aims to investigate the impact that digital transformation has on non-profit organisations. For this research step, we initially identified the dataset of contributions discussing the topic under investigation. Then, we refined the initial dataset, restricting the corpus to 111 papers. The resulting dataset was used to develop the taxonomy. By adopting a conceptual and empirical analysis, we identified the following five dimensions (and their relative values): Digital Aim, Scope, NPO Relevance, Digital Technology, Business Aim. Finally, for every dimension, one single value was assigned to each paper, proposing a useful taxonomy for classifying the contributions investigating digital transformation in non-profit organisations over the last decades. Furthermore, focusing on a subset of dimensions (Digital Aim, Scope, NPO Relevance), we summarize some preliminary results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To continue the debate on the most effective FOP labels for increased consumer health, full comprehension of their visual and functional features is relevant. This paper compares and provides an overview of all FOP labels currently in practice or in preparation in Europe, by means of the visually oriented Funnel Model. The Funnel Models were completed in collaboration with the respective FOP labelling initiatives. In total, six positive FOP labels, two mixed FOP labels and one negative FOP label were compared. There are multiple similarities and differences between the FOP labels, with each FOP label being characterised by a unique set of criteria and methodological approach. This Funnel Model comparison provides the knowledge to ultimately find more common ground for all stakeholders involved in the FOP labelling debate. Importantly, implementation and evaluation activities carried out by FOP labelling organisations are crucial success factors for FOP labels in practice. We conclude that more attention should be paid to methodological differences between FOP labels and recommend that the current comparison is expanded to a global level and periodically updated, as the variety of FOP labels in the global marketplace is changing constantly. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Trust is an important factor for managing transaction costs within interorganizational relationships (IORs). Research on trust indicates that separate dimensions of trust arise from a partner’s competence (i.e., technical skills, experience, and reliability) and integrity (i.e., motives, honesty, and character), and that these dimensions have potentially unique effects. Because scholars rarely apply this distinction within IOR research, past studies may have masked important relationships involving competence- and integrity-based trust. In response, we build and test theory that explains how competence- and integrity-based trust have asymmetric effects on different kinds of transaction costs. In particular, we build on theory that describes how parties process positive and negative information about others’ behavior to predict that integrity-based trust in IORs is more potent for reducing transaction costs than is competence-based trust. We also theorize that building strong IORs requires more up-front investment with competence-based but not with integrity-based trust. By applying meta-analytic structural equation modeling to data on 37,366 IORs drawn from 150 samples, we find that integrity-based trust is about 10 times more effective at reducing these costs. A key implication is that managers seeking to improve the efficiency of their IORs may do well by performing competently, but they can do even better by building perceptions of integrity. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

This chapter synthesizes the findings of 35 studies of knowledge transfer in the transition phase and extrapolates these findings to discuss implications in the era of digital business strategy and agility. A key finding from the review is that months or even years of scaffolded practice through learning tasks are often required before engineers have acquired sufficient domain-specific knowledge to take over the service. These findings suggests that, to harness the potentials associated with digital business strategy and agility while doing outsourcing or offshoring, clients may need to rely on long-term, embedded relationships vendors, on learning tasks and feedback, and on technologies that reduce complexity. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Erik Beulen and Pieter M.

	abstract = {The article presents recommendations for effective building of leadership capacity in the context of the educational reform in post-Soviet Georgia. The Government of Georgia has introduced several reforms since passing the educational reform law in 2005, among others also continuous professional development programmes to upgrade teachers’ competencies to face the evolving challenges of the modern classroom. Nevertheless, the practice of teaching has remained top-down and teacher-centred, the same as practised in the Soviet era. While teacher professional development is essential for successful educational reform implementation, this article also points to the importance of school leadership in creating the conditions in schools that support teachers’ implementation efforts. The majority of Georgian schools lack such capable leadership. The recommendation for leadership training that will support stretching the practice of leadership over multiple leaders in Georgian schools was made based on research, and on recognising the country’s systemic weaknesses in policy and practice of school leadership. While the presented recommendations are specific to Georgian context, they are also generalisable to the post-socialist countries that are facing similar policy and practice weaknesses, and could thus benefit from the application of a similar approach. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Building on current research on family businesses and crisis communication on social media, the authors investigated seven Instagram profiles of family-owned hotels in Tyrol and its borders. The data were collected in spring and summer 2020 and then analyzed using a mixed-method approach. First, the researchers did a quantitative analysis of the hashtags and then conducted a qualitative content analysis of the pictures and respective captions. The results show that information relating to the crisis is rarely communicated and the focus of communication rather lies on positive attitudes, emotions, and classic alpine marketing topics. During the crisis, the hotels present themselves as resilient and anchored in their family values. This chapter adds new insights to current research on family firms' crisis communication and provides valuable findings for the development of a successful communication strategy for family businesses. © 2021, IGI Global. © 2021 by IGI Global.},

The paper aims to highlight new risks stemming from BYOD adoption and identifies different security paradoxes arising for entrepreneurs and their employees in the context of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical approach is proposed in this paper. As technology is an important driver of organizational change, technological innovations entail new work practices and in turn lead to a twofold “security paradox.” Findings: This paper introduces the stakes and issues associated with BYOD-related mobile technologies. Evidence is provided that this phenomenon must be cautiously addressed to not only seize related benefits but also reduce related risks. Avenues for future research are offered to complement this work. Practical implications: The main practical interest is to make entrepreneurs of SMEs and their employees aware of the BYOD phenomenon and its related risks and benefits. Originality/value: From a theoretical perspective, very little work has been published in the field of management sciences about the benefits and dangers associated with the introduction of BYOD among entrepreneurs and employees in SMEs. Moreover, this study identifies a twofold “security paradox” related to information security that has never been studied in work settings. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to connect workspace design to employee wellbeing and social sustainability. Toward this connection, we introduce and empirically test a new concept of “workspace integration”. This concept refers to the continuum of integration of an employee’s workspace with the organizational, physical space. We further define three workspace affordances that predict the social sustainability of workspace arrangements by influencing employee wellbeing. The three affordances are perceptions of symbolism of the organization and of symbolism of the self, and opportunities for social interactions. We evaluate our theory using data collected from an online survey of British employees (n = 392) working in offices at home and/or in the organization in various industries. As predicted, workspace integration positively influences wellbeing directly as well as indirectly via mediation of symbolism of the organization and opportunities for social interactions. The third affordance—symbolism of the self—positively influences wellbeing, but is not affected by workspace integration. Our findings confirm the impact of workspace affordances on employee wellbeing, and thus their utility for the analysis of social sustainability. The findings also contribute to understanding of the differences between workspace symbolism of the organization and of the self, their impact on wellbeing, and thus their implications for social sustainability.

It also attempts to study the moderating role of management support on the influential relationship between these organizational and cultural factors and OL within the context of Jordanian mining sector (JMS). Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive-analytical approach is applied to collect and analyze the data. A survey questionnaire is used as a primary data collection instrument. The study sample includes 400 participants from the seven selected manufacturing companies within the context of JMS. Smart PLS 3 and IBM SPSS version 25 were applied to answer the study questions and to test the hypotheses. Findings: Organization strategy has a statistical significant impact on OL. Moreover, cultural factors (innovation; teamwork; knowledge sharing) have a significant impact on OL. The results of the moderating variable revealed that the level of management support is not moderating the relationship between organizational factors and OL. Nonetheless, it is revealed that management support is moderating the relationship between organizational culture and OL. Practical implications: It seems that a continuous management support is an important facilitating feature to motivate a learning culture. Cultural attributes, including innovation, teamwork and knowledge sharing must be taken into consideration as facilitating factors to encourage OL. Gradual changes must be introduced to create innovative, teamwork and knowledge-sharing culture. Additionally, a specific strategic goal should be part of the organizational corporate strategy and action plans must be developed to achieve this goal in a systematic manner. Originality/value: The inclusion of management support as a moderating factor could add an original contribution to the current body of knowledge concerning OL. Moreover, this study argues that the core concept of learning might be there but a systematic process of learning and the contextual factors influencing this concept still need more concern. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In addition, global trends, fierce competition on a global scale and climate change are changing the work environment permanently (Helmold, 2020). New Work is the epitome of this transformation. There are many triggers for this development. Digitization, connectivity and globalization as well as demographic change are among the causes of the change in the world of work. The question of how we deal with the megatrend New Work is becoming increasingly important for companies (Evsan, 2020). The reason why is that companies have to compete not only between themselves, they also have to compete for talents and employees. New Work measures and concepts are one opportunity to win this battle for talents (Bergmann, 2019). New technologies, digitization, automation and comprehensive networking mean that certain professions are becoming superfluous. Industrial production has changed radically in recent decades. The new way of thinking, the desire for change, the desire for meaning, personal development but also digitalization and thus also the developments in the field of artificial intelligence will pose more and more people in the “old working world” the question of what they want to do in the future (Bergmann, 2019).

Through access to secondary data, cases and examples, collected in extensive research and following the International Labour Organization (ILO) methodologies, we describe important benefits, problems and success factors regarding telework, which are always dependent on ICTs and leadership support. Owing to the lack of official data, the incidence of telework must be calculated indirectly based on the combination of other surveys. Results show that 16.2 per cent of the Brazilian workforce participates in telework. Important factors such as the correlation among type of organization, type of job and intensity of the incidence are described, as is what is important from the employees’ side to increase the possibility of successful implementation. The chapter also presents advancements in Brazilian legislation and work regulation systems, showing the several law projects, ordinances and other measures that legally support telework.

This study shows that holistic (versus organization-centric) information behavioral preferences are related to interaction and exchange oriented perceptions of the success of work. The findings were drawn from a partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) based analysis of the survey data (N = 305) collected from employees of a large multinational corporation. The findings suggest that holistic information behavior is more strongly related to social measures of success, whereas their association with quantitative measures tends to be lower. From the perspective of information behavior research, the findings suggest that holism seems to be a similar factor to, for instance, task complexity or personality, which influences human information behavior and, for instance, perceptions of relevance. From a practical perspective, the study suggests that the promotion of specific facets of measuring success and patterns of information behavior can be used to influence the orientation of working between centrifugality and openness. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The main aim of this study is to explore the moderating effect of information and communication technology tools on the relationship between networking services and Business Incubator (BI) success in Palestine. Business incubators are considered to offer important guidance that can help young firms to survive during their early stages. Many developing countries are currently suffering from a critical economic situation, especially, Arab countries where the unemployment rate is very high and the gross domestic product is very low compared to developed countries. Many success models have been proposed to measure the success of Business Incubators (BIs) in developed and developing countries. Also, many studies have examined the impact of ICT tools on economic and business development but very few have been conducted in Palestine. Therefore, this study investigates the role of networking services as a critical success factor in the performance of BIs in Palestine and also determines whether ICT tools moderate the relationship between networking services and BI success because it has been argued that ICT tools facilitate economic growth by accelerating knowledge sharing and increase the new product development activities and competition in the marketplace. This study adopted a descriptive survey consisting of six main stages that were administrated in 22-79 incubator managers, team members and experts in Palestine. The results show that networking services were one of the important factors that are affecting the incubator success in Palestine and the ICT tools moderate the relationship between networking services and incubator success. © Medwell Journals, 2018.},

This multiple case study examined SHRM implementation levels in a sample of oil and gas companies with the aim of examining the extent to which communication flows reflect the level of SHRM implementation. The case studies showed similarly low levels of SHRM-related communication and SHRM implementation, suggesting the need for further research to explore this relationship. The authors propose that SHRM-related communication could be an additional factor in assessing SHRM implementation levels and that organisational design must be considered in understanding low levels of SHRM-related communication.

This research explores the association between EI and project performance in the context of large-scale infrastructure projects. Specifically, it proposes a model demonstrating a positive link between EI and project performance through adverse relationships with three negative conflict types (relationship, teak, and process). Further, it hypothesises that trust plays a moderating role. To test the model, we collected data from 365 project team members in large-scale infrastructure projects. The empirical results demonstrate that EI is positively linked to performance in large-scale infrastructure projects, and that this association is facilitated by EI's negative link to three conflict modes (task, relationship, process), which are negatively connected to performance. Additionally, inter-personal trust was found to moderate the negative relationship between conflict and project performance.

Responsible team climate, a knowledge-based trust factor, impacts clients’ trust in vendors in the team-storming and norming stages of software design and development. Structural assurance, an institutional trust factor, encourages vendors’ trust in clients in the same team-storming and norming stages of software design and development. Benefit, a calculative-based trust factor, influences vendors’ trust in clients in the team-performing stage of software delivery and implementation.

Evidence suggests an increase in the number of working women, yet there is relative neglect toward identifying issues involving women in the industry. Design/methodology/approach: Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to content-analyze the narrative on the sampled articles from a Maldives-based hospitality magazine, Hotelier Maldives. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative methods report on the challenges faced by women managers and reasons for their success based on the narratives. Findings: This study revealed that although women managers are underrepresented in management, there has been a broad increase in the participation of women within the industry. This study falsified the perception that gender is a limiting factor to hold senior positions in the hospitality industry and that increased participation of women managers may be driven by the changing social and cultural contexts. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine how women managers are represented in hospitality magazines. Despite its relevance, previous tourism research has not focused on this kind of measurement. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The digitalisation of the construction industry and consequently the implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is currently one of the biggest challenges in the construction industry. A key success factor are – though still missing – (young) professionals with adequate BIM-knowledge. This was recognized by higher education institutions, so that BIM is already taught at many higher education institutions. In the first part of the paper the status quo and development of academic teaching of BIM from 2015–2017 is presented. In 2015 28 out of 69 (41 %) higher education institutions offered BIM. Over the last two years the number has risen to 41 (59 %) higher education institutions. In addition to that the distinction between universities and universities of applied sciences as well as the differences between architecture and civil engineering degree programs are considered. In the second part of the paper the target state of BIM learning contents is defined. Afterwards in the examination the current state is depicted to reveal the gap between target and current state. Based on this, recommendations for higher education institutions are made. Especially BIM modules with interdisciplinary BIM-projects, where students experience the new work and communications processes, need to be increased.

The core values of the New Work concept are independence, freedom and participation in the community as outlined by the scientist Bergmann back in the 1980s. In addition to freedom and participation, New Work also integrates elements like liberty or self-esteem, a purposeful profession, development and social responsibility as shown in Fig. 1.1. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The study groups of the participating farms were particularly important. They provided the foundations and data necessary for establishing research questions and worked intensively to implement the new work practices. This triggered numerous innovations on the farms and supported the transfer of knowledge through concrete actions. To achieve this effect, an important precondition had to be fulfilled: the careful selection of highly motivated farms willing to exchange thoughts and experiences freely with each other. Additional success factors were the intensive support of the project leaders and also, unusually, of moderators as important hubs of communication among the participants. The combination of these factors placed high demands on all concerned and these were largely met in this project, as our investigations show. © 2018, A M T R A - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

This work proposes to fill gaps in the studies about innovativeness effects on competitiveness in emerging countries specifically from the electric and electronic industry perspective. The innovativeness was analysed from three first-order constructs: organizational learning, predisposition for innovation and innovation diffusivity. Competitiveness was studied by performance. The cross-section data were collected through a survey with 102 executives from the supply network of the Brazilian electrical and electronic industry and were analysed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. The results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between innovativeness and competitiveness, highlighting the robustness of two factors (predisposition for innovation and innovation diffusivity), and the three first-order constructs are significant predictors of competitiveness. The theoretical and managerial implications recommend knowledge-sharing practices, technical qualification and management incentive to people's innovative attitude as a basis for building innovative environments and expanding competitiveness. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a quantitative approach using a survey approach. The survey is a study conducted on the employee population of state-owned public agency companies, samples taken from the employee population of state-owned public agency companies to find events related to discipline variables and work environments that can affect employee productivity variables, to analise the influence between discipline variables and the work environment on employee productivity variables using a statistic regression approach. This method is used to explain the influence of discipline variables and work environment on employee productivity variables. This approach is simply to provide a description and test the influence between discipline variables and the work environment on employee productivity variables that can be known how much the influence of discipline variables and work environment on employee productivity variables. Findings: The findings of this study explain that discipline has an influence on the productivity of employees of publicly owned companies, the work environment has an influence on the productivity of employees of publicly owned companies, while together discipline and work environment have an influence on the productivity of employees of publicly owned companies. Practical Implications: The results of the study are recommended for employees to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the performance of state-owned public bodies.

It shows how movement to virtual modes of working, especially virtual teams, can help practitioners meet the current crisis effectively and also prepare for future crisis efficiently. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to show how the concept of virtuality can help design practices which enable managers/practitioners in effectively managing necessary transitions to virtual work. METHODS: The article reviews and integrates essential literature on virtuality and virtual teams. It enumerates the benefits and challenges which accompany a sudden and necessary movement to virtual work in teams. Also used are the recently developed theoretical frameworks of teams as essential emergent states and its implications on virtual work. RESULTS: By distilling insights from past literature, the article advises managers on how to deal with the present and prepare for future disruptions. Usage of overarching frameworks rather than industry/work specific literature enables managers to move away from specific recommendations and focus on general characteristics for wider impact. CONCLUSIONS: The article demonstrates how organizations can meet disruptive challenges successfully and also prepare for future challenges sustainably using virtuality as a starting point.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

E-government has numerous benefits, but there are many challenges to implement e-government. The government spends tremendous sums of money on the implementation of e-government services to support citizens, but the effectiveness of these projects depends very much on the adoption of employees. Very limited attention has been paid for understanding the adoption of e-government by employees. This research has attempted to identify those factors which have not been reported in the previous studies by using the qualitative analysis technique. From the analysis of the participants' interviews, nine major themes have emerged which reflects the influencing factors of e-government adoption among employees. The nine themes are perceived determinant value, administrative issues, organisational dynamics, physical and technological resources, e-government website, attitude to use, trust issues, exogenous factors, and auxiliary services.  © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Tactical planning aims at demand–supply (DS) balancing by ensuring cross-functional integration (CFI), which incorporates coordination as one dimension. This study uses a case study approach to identify the key coordination mechanisms applied in the customer order fulfilment processes (COFPs) to mitigate the negative impact of complexity on DS balancing in four ETO-oriented settings. Within-case analyses identify the applied mechanisms, and a cross-case analysis elaborates on how they influence the detail and uncertainty in decision-making and problem-solving activities. Findings suggest a positive effect of formalized activity sequences, balanced team compositions, effective task designs and supportive information systems (ISs); and a positive (but contingent) effect of the other mechanisms. Future research may address other CFI dimensions (collaboration), statistically test the findings, or qualitatively deepen the understanding of the forms and impacts of individual mechanisms. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose - Previous studies that have attempted to link TQM and employees' satisfaction are either theoretical without empirical evidence or had limited outcome in scope as they link only few elements of TQM with employees' job satisfaction and commitment. This study is warranted due to the paucity of insights into the impact of soft strategies on determining job satisfaction and commitment. Despite the considerable body of TQM literature that has evolved to examine the relationship between TQM and employees' job satisfaction in various countries as well as industries there is no existing literature that recognizes the soft aspects of TQM within the context of the Indian manufacturing industry. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - On the basis of the proposed hypotheses a conceptual model was proposed and tested. A questionnaire survey was employed for data collection. The participants were 450 shop floor employees of three Indian manufacturing organizations. Findings - The results have shown that six out of the nine soft aspects of TQM played a role in determining job satisfaction and commitment. The results have also shown that the predictors of both job satisfaction and commitment were the same except for the strength of prediction. The proposed model showed an acceptable fit. Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the impact of soft aspects of TQM in determining job satisfaction and commitment in the Indian manufacturing organizations. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We performed an in-depth case examination on six multinational subsidiaries of a large Finnish firm. We identify two learning modes of multinational subsidiaries that we refer to as managerial and entrepreneurial learning. We find that managerial learning shares characteristics with the systems-structural learning perspective; is facilitated by embeddedness of the subsidiary in the MNE system; and, transferred in the MNE through many conventional and reverse knowledge flows. On the contrary, entrepreneurial learning shares characteristics with the interpretive learning perspective; is facilitated by embeddedness of the subsidiary in the host country; and, transferred in the MNE through relatively fewer reverse knowledge flows. The distinction between these two learning modes and their discrete characteristics enlighten past research that has largely failed to pinpoint the importance of the two modes for MNE subsidiary activities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We examined 1425 manager position job advertisements in the major Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat between 1949 and 2009. Our results show that emotional requirements were rather uncommon during the post-war era but that they became key characteristics in job advertisements towards the end of the century. Feminine management ideals emerged from the 1960s onwards in line with the changing nature of work, organizational developments and increasing equality of social relations. However, the economic slowdown of the 1970s was followed by a new emphasis on masculine qualities. We argue that the emergence of emotional management reflects the changes in the cultural, social and economic order, in which social codes stressing equality became a rule, and emotional qualities were recognized as tools for increasing productivity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Effective management of knowledge is currently recognised as the foundation of any organisation to maximise its abilities and achieve business targets. Organisations strive to leverage knowledge stocks - mostly held in the minds of their individual employees - in order to create value and drive success. For organisations to promote effective knowledge management, they have to develop innovative methods to encourage knowledge sharing practices. Knowledge sharing (KS) is a vital organisational process which empowers individuals to confront challenges of uncertainty and complexity, instils best practices, and enables the transfer of knowledge between different parts of the organisation. Given the fact that knowledge is always a valuable asset, individuals tend to hoard knowledge for different reasons. Therefore, sharing knowledge is predominantly a voluntary process and only subject to the willingness of the individual to engage in the process. Studies have demonstrated that KS cannot be forced or mandated rather than fostered by facilitative efforts in order to motivate employees to share their tacit knowledge. The aim of the study is to evaluate the collective factors supporting the willingness of employees to share knowledge. After which, providing a summarised generic list of the terms illustrated throughout the extant literature. Previous research has shown that influencers such as the 'perceptions' of organisational culture, trust, infrastructure, and leadership, are among the most prominent determinants of KS within the corporate environment. There are other extrinsic motivators and social-psychological forces that can contribute to the increase of the behaviour of KS. Technology advances are also considered as an enabler because it can help in both direct and indirect transfer of knowledge. The findings provide researchers with an overall topology of the factors of KS, and equally offer useful insights for managers seeking to enhance willingness to share knowledge within their firms.},

	abstract = {The process of managing large-scale projects networks is highly complex. Building and maintaining effective interactions is critical for the successful completion of such endeavors. Network actors need to cope with unplanned events and disturbances throughout the implementation of the project. In safetycritical environments, it is of vital importance to ensure adequate safety of the entire multi-actor and culturally diverse network. The achievement of this goal is, however, far from simple. Previous research revealed a positive link between project actors' cooperation and safety performance in the construction industry. Provided the opportunity to learn from other members, project networks have a huge potential for disseminating positive safety practices. However, it takes competent and continuous collaborative efforts to unlock this potential and to integrate a wide range of diverse stakeholder safety perspectives. To better support building up safety throughout the multi-cultural networks, technical expertise of project leaders should be complemented by relational capability and cross-cultural awareness. The paper offers a novel extension of a contemporary systemic approach to safety by shifting the focus from a single organization towards a network of organizations. As a result, a conceptualization of network safety and its improvement is proposed, based on the interplay between three constructs: network governance, shared understanding and interfirm heedfulness. The research contributes to the safety literature by indicating that producing and enhancing network safety is not only about managing interactions but also about managing the emergent phenomena that result from the interactions. The study provides insights on managing network safety by using Olkiluoto 3 construction site in Finland as a case example. Copyright © (2012) by IAPSAM & ESRA.},

Notwithstanding the increasing maturity levels in practice, organizations still struggle with the successful establishment of EAM, mainly due to the inherent challenges of a firmly centralized approach in complex organizational settings. This study opts for cooperative learning as a theoretical lens to afford a distinctive, non-centralized conceptualization of EAM. We empirically demonstrate EAM as a stage-wise learning process in which knowledge acquisition and cooperative interactions among individuals contribute to project performance on the local level. Projects that benefit from this particular learning process, in turn, are found to significantly leverage enterprise-wide performance.},

In the paper, we develop two empirical studies to examine both the positive effects and negative effects of using social networking tools for work. Our finding indicates that using social networking tools increases group effectiveness, which results in improvement of group identity. Nevertheless, using social networking tools for work also blurs the boundary of work-life, which may raise the work load and work-home conflict. We concluded that both academics and practice should pay attention to and minimize the negative impact of increased work overload and work-home conflict induced by using social networking tools for work.

Yet implementation has often proved to be difficult and the factors which are critical to success are not yet well understood. In this paper existing research in the area of critical success factors (CSFs) is examined and it is suggested that that research actually covers two distinct phenomena. One approach is focused on identifying the factors required for a specific individual to achieve their outcomes. The second on determining the general success factors for implementing a project of a certain type. A reconciliation of the two approaches is proposed within a framework that distinguishes between three different types of CSF – outcome, implementation process and operating environment characteristic. A case study of a project to implement shared services in the Australian public sector is examined using the reconciled framework. The case shows that the reconciled approach by including, and differentiating between, outcome, process and operating environment characteristic factors provides a richer and more complete picture of requirements. Further benefits from the synthesis are also highlighted including that factors are a mix of universal and context specific, different perspectives on factors exist and not all environmental factors perceived to be critical have to necessarily be present. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the mediation effect of OC did not exist for financial performance. Research limitations/implications – The key theoretical contribution is the use of performance assessment based on critical success factors of hotel businesses and the bootstrapping regression model. Practical implications – Senior managers should pay attention to TLS qualities when appointing core managers, provide on-going structured TLS training and concentrate on leading performance dimensions for performance assessment.

Prior studies have shed light on effective governance structures in different organizational contexts. This study aims to advance this prior knowledge by exploring how interpersonal networks, as an important aspect of such context, reflect and influence ITO governance. Design/methodology/approach – A single case study was conducted from a vendor’s perspective in an ITO dyad. Social network analysis was leveraged to reveal the interpersonal networks, with whole-network analysis on 24 team members in an ITO vendor company. In addition, open-ended interviews with six selected team members were utilized to identify the perceived governance structure. Findings – The findings of this study suggest certain features of interpersonal networks, i.e. network density and cross-network comparison, can reflect governance structure in multiple aspects. Meanwhile, the authors also argue that interpersonal networks can influence the form of governance structure. Research limitations/implications – As a single case study, the context of the research site cannot be ignored in the inference of findings. To increase the confidence for further generalization, future empirical studies are needed especially in contrasting sites, such as ITO relations based on network governance. Originality/value – This study associates intra-organizational characteristics of the vendor to the inter-organizational governance structure of the ITO relationship.

The article proceeds to argue that current cohorts of young people in all Western countries will become the vanguard of a successor generation, distinguished by a different youth life stage and also by different characteristic experience of adulthood and, eventually, a different politics than the generation's predecessor. It is argued that the new generation's situation arose initially within the working classes and has now spread upwards. The article suggests that this new trend is unlikely to be reversed on account of (1) economic growth rates in Western countries slowing since the three decades that immediately followed the Second World War; (2) labour's declining share of gross domestic product and wider income inequalities within countries; (3) costs of imported commodities will most likely continue to rise; (4) new cohorts of workers will have to bear some of the costs of supporting swollen cohorts of retired citizens, tackling pollution and alleviating climate change; (5) the costs of raising children are likely to continue to rise and new cohorts of workers will most likely need to make some private provisions for their own health care and retirement incomes; (6) there are now excessive numbers of higher education graduates in all world regions relative to the number of graduate jobs; and (7) the changing class demography in West Europe and North America. The article concludes by considering possible outcomes which include intensified inter- and intra-generational conflict. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The recession that began in 2007 resulted in organizational retrenchment strategies focused on workforce reductions. In order to successfully emerge from this crisis and sustain long-term viability for their organizations, managers needed to reengage surviving employees and minimize the potential for retaliatory behavior by the victims of the downsizing activities. An understanding of the perceptions of both survivors and victims is critical when managers implement downsizing and recovery strategies. The psychological contract and attribution theory were used to examine employee perceptions post downsizing. The variables of interest in this study include employee perceptions related to organizational communication; understanding and agreement with organizational strategy; local management's involvement in downsizing decisions; management responsiveness to employee needs; perceived fairness; optimism about the future of the company; and job security. A survey of 540 adults registered in an accelerated bachelor's of business administration program during 2009 completed a downsizing survey designed for this study. This study found perceptual differences between the survivors and victims related to corporate management's responsiveness to employee needs during downsizing; the fairness of the layoff decisions; managements' favoritism in the layoff decisions; employee optimism about the future of the organization; and employee nervousness about job security.

Some e-health communities are for people who need to change their established bad, or unhealthy, habits such as the ones for people suffering from overweight or smoking. To develop and maintain a healthier life-style is not an easy task to succeed with, it involves being able to change everyday situations. E-health communities can assist in this process through continuous interactions between community members. However, whether these e-health communities actively support learning depends on the ways they help community members reflect upon their habits, underlying reasons and motivational factors. In this chapter, the author presents a framework for how to evaluate these e-health communities from a learning perspective. The framework covers different types of conversation topics, ways to respond and community knowledge. © 2013 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

It particularly applies the competing values framework to the study of individuals’ orientations toward sharing knowledge with others while also investigating the influence of top management support on such orientations. Design/methodology/approach - To test the proposed hypotheses, in this paper, survey data of 389 employees from six Italian subsidiaries are empirically analyzed by running hierarchical regressions on the two dimensions of knowledge-sharing processes, i.e. knowledge donating and knowledge collecting. Findings - The results show that the four types of organizational culture differently affect the knowledge-sharing sub-processes and confirm the importance of a strong top management support to facilitate interpersonal relationships. Research limitations/implications - Despite the cross-sectional nature of the data and the limitations arising from the subsidiaries’ position in the country, the findings suggest managers to pay great attention to the positive side of bureaucracy by emphasizing the need for order and efficiency while, at the same time, providing employees with a constant and encouraging support toward knowledgesharing activities. Originality/value - The paper adds empirical evidence to the limited existing research on knowledge-sharing sub-processes of knowledge donating and collecting, extends the understanding of how different organizational cultures affect such processes, and contributes to the literature on MNCs’ knowledge-based activities by adopting a subsidiary perspective. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

One area of increasing adoption is organizational settings where managers hope that these new technologies will help improve important organizational processes. However, scholarship has largely failed to explain if and how uses of social media in organizations differ from existing forms of computer-mediated communication. In this chapter, we argue that social media are of important consequence to organizational communication processes because they afford behaviors that were difficult or impossible to achieve in combination before these new technologies entered the workplace. Our review of previous studies of social media use in organizations uncovered four relatively consistent affordances enabled by these new technologies: Visibility, persistence, editability, and association. We suggest that the activation of some combination of these affordances could infiuence many of the processes commonly studied by organizational communication theorists. To illustrate this point, we theorize several ways through which these four social media affordances may alter socialization, knowledge sharing, and power processes in organizations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Further, it aims to examine the moderating effect of trust in co-workers on the emotional intelligence-knowledge sharing relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 121 employees working with 13 different service sector organizations in the northern region of India. The data were tested for validity and reliability. Hierarchical regression analysis was performed to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results indicated that both emotional intelligence and trust in co-workers had significant direct effects on knowledge sharing of organizational members. However, trust in co-workers did not moderate emotional intelligence-knowledge sharing relationship. Research limitations/implications: The limitations include the sample and cross-sectional design. Hence, future studies can be conducted using a longitudinal design covering other regions of India to increase the generalizability of findings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that management should develop appropriate strategies for meliorating emotional intelligence level of employees because people with higher emotional intelligence are more likely to engage themselves in knowledge sharing. Additionally, organizations should adopt a culture that promotes trust among its members, thereby fostering knowledge sharing in organizations. Originality/value: There is limited literature on the role of emotions in knowledge sharing. The study adds to the extant literature on emotional intelligence and knowledge sharing in the context of India. Besides, the study attempted to investigate the interaction effect of trust in co-workers on emotional intelligence-knowledge sharing relationship that has not been studied so far. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The non-repetitive nature of projects, globalization, the growing number of distributed project teams, and the substantial number of high-tech projects in which the human brain is the most important resource are just few of the forces making human resource management in projects a critical success factor. These conditions challenge not only project team members' ability to collaborate, but also the capacity of the project manager to effectively manage human resources and to facilitate a collaborative work environment. The quantitative aspects of project management, such as scheduling, budgeting, and resource management, are supported by a large array of tools and techniques, many of them based on operations research methodologies and integrated into commercially available software for project management. However, these commercial software packages for project management offer very little support for the development and management of project teams. In this monograph we review the project management and organizational behavior literature, focusing on key issues in the management of human resources in projects. We then present a model that relates the use of integrative project management tools and techniques to the development of a shared understanding in teams, and to the occurrence of effective team processes. From a practical point of view, we present team integration - the process by which the goals and work processes of individual team members are assembled into a coordinated whole - as an important success factor. With the art and science of human resource management in projects growing increasingly important in today's global high-tech environment, we cannot ignore the gap between the needs of project managers and the tools available to support their efforts. Our model offers an approach toward overcoming this gap. We present some recent results of our research that support elements of this model, and also point to a new direction - the use of simulators to develop a shared understanding among project team members and to achieve team integration early in the project initiation phase. The results of our efforts to develop such tool - the Project Team Builder - are reported as well. © 2013 S. Ravid, A. Shtub, A. Rafaeli and E. Glikson.},

Interculturality is conceptualized as the interaction between individuals and not just the cohabitation between various national cultures. We draw on the concepts of social regulation, which represents a process of social rule-making, and observational learning to propose a conceptual framework based on three research propositions that analyses the dynamic relationship between culture and intercultural learning accumulated via social regulation. In this context, we conjecture that interculturality in offshore virtual teams is not only expressed through electronic communication but also through the way of perception and execution of daily work tasks.

This improves the speed and quality of product development, provided that face-to-face contact is not completely replaced by virtual contact. A basic level of face-to face contact is necessary to offset the negative effects of telework on the quality of the shared knowledge, which are larger when the knowledge is sticky. Flexible work schedules and unexpectedly hot-desking were found to increase telework usage. This implies for managers that workplace flexibility needs enablers and cannot do without a sufficient level of face-to-face contact. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Knowledge management in organizations aims to create an environment that facilitates knowledge work in order to improve knowledge creation and organizational performance. Since social software has been added to the portfolio of technologies for knowledge management, the emphasis of support for knowledge work has shifted from collecting manifestations of knowledge to connecting people. While this strategic move tremendously increased the connectivity of people, there is little evidence on its effects on knowledge creation. Building on the concept of knowledge activities and theories of organizational knowledge creation, we investigate how organizational and IT mechanisms that support collecting and connecting activities affect knowledge creation using a stratified sample of 126 European organizations. The paper offers two contributions to explain knowledge creation in organizations: (1) we empirically validate the claim that individual knowledge creation is a prerequisite of collective knowledge creation; (2) we differentiate between support for collecting and connecting activities and explain the link between organizational and IT mechanisms as input and knowledge creation as output. Organizations can promote knowledge creation by a strategy that combines support for collecting and connecting activities, and designs mechanisms for collecting activities targeted at individuals plus mechanisms for connecting activities targeted at individuals and collectives. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprised doctors - department heads of 123 clinical departments of basic medical specialties operating in 15 hospitals and was addressed by the use of a questionnaire specifically designed for the purposes of this research effort. The results were processed with the use of exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regression was applied. Findings: The research results revealed a positive impact of interactive internal service quality characteristics and learning organization dimensions, namely, empowerment and continuous learning, on job satisfaction in hospital care services. Originality/value: This research effort focuses, for the first time, on clinical leadership perceptions in public hospital care services. The relationship between internal service quality, learning organization and job satisfaction, can be critical in all efforts attempting to improve clinical departments functionality, thus the results of this survey provide both researchers and public health policy makers with a useful tool for the design and implementation of such efforts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

They are considered to be an entrepreneurial and economic development instrument that can increase the creativity of new firms including small and mid-sized enterprises and that can support them in the early stage of development which is the most vulnerable stage of their existence. Small and mid-sized enterprises are crucial for enhancing innovation, productivity, competitiveness, social cohesion, and economic development in developed and developing countries. They are also crucial in minimizing unemployment; they create a lot of jobs and significant output in many countries. The economy in many developing countries, especially Arab countries, is in a critical state. The unemployment rate is very high and gross domestic product is very low compared to developed countries. Many types of success models have been proposed and used to measure the success and performance of business incubators in developed countries. However, a limited number of studies and success models have been published on this topic in the case of the developing world. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose a model using a combination of well-known and new success factors for business incubator success in developing countries.},

This paper expounds upon veillance to include watching each other (coveillance), watching one's self (self-surveillance), and the umbrella concept of webveillance (watching of and on the Internet). We argue that these forms of veillance, as conducted through self-management programs, techniques, and technologies, affect the relationship between patients and clinicians, transform the allocation of medical responsibilities, alter the architecture of healthcare, and expand the places in which healthcare is performed. This has significant implications on online activities of patients and clinicians, as well as how and by whom healthcare is conducted in the doctor's office, the home, and public spaces. © 2016, First Monday.},

With those in the sector hoping to challenge more established outsourcing destinations in the global industry, Kenya’s potential has been based on a particular geographic, cultural and human resource profiling, emphasizing its suitability for voice-based call centre services. In light of BPOs’ association with ‘development’, this article draws upon the people-centred concept of ‘wellbeing’ to explore the implications of the expansion of the sector and the onus on internationally oriented call centre labour. Underlining the need to foreground existing workers’ experiences, the article argues that the picture for those employed in the sector has been mixed with respect to the material, relational and subjective gains from the work. While agents recruited describe beneficial and recognized work experience, the work has yet to represent a stable, long-term professional prospect, with the sector beset by an inconsistent financial record. © 2014 Centre of African Studies, University of Edinburgh.},

	abstract = {A number of authors have stressed that competitive advantage through knowledge management is realized through identifying the valuable representation, organization, acquisition, creation, usage, and evolution of knowledge in its many forms that the organization knows or could know now: skills and experience of people, archives, documents, relations with clients, suppliers, and other persons and materials often contained in electronic databases. In so doing, this chapter covers the various types of knowledge, the Learning Organization (LO), and Organizational Learning (OL). This chapter also covers the history and meaning of knowledge (management), LO, and OL in terms of how all three elements are interrelated. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between LO and OL. With that said, the chapter explains why the role of knowledge transfer and human resources management is a top down approach and not a bottom up approach. © 2014, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine how different SOs, namely learning orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation and brand orientation simultaneously affect business performance measured with brand performance, market performance and business growth in SME context and whether these effects vary across countries. – An extensive data set of 1,120 effective responses is collected from two European countries, namely Hungary, representing a post socialist rapidly growing market, and Finland with a stable, highly developed and competitive economy. A multigroup moderation analysis is conducted. Confirmatory factor analysis is used in testing measurement invariance, subsequently followed by structural equation modeling procedure used in testing research hypotheses developed on the basis of a literature review. – The results show that entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation and brand orientation have a positive effect on business growth in SMEs in both Hungary and Finland through brand and market performance. With regard to learning orientation, a positive yet somewhat weak effect on growth is found only in the Hungarian sample. The moderation analysis reveals that country moderates several of the hypothesized paths from SOs to business performance. – Prior studies on SOs have mainly focussed on single orientations at any given time. However, researchers increasingly argue that many firms are better off if they build their strategies on multiple SOs. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first empirical studies to address multiple (four) SOs in the same research model. Furthermore, little is known about if and how the performance effects of different SOs vary across countries. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Many organizations have developed knowledge sharing programs, such as mentoring, and knowledge transfer from retired employees, in order to articulate and maintain valuable knowledge. Knowledge sharing leads to the spreading of innovative ideas and best practices. It consists of two important processes: knowledge contribution and knowledge reception. However, knowledge reception can be failed with several reasons. This research metaphorically terms the factors obstructing knowledge reception as the virtual earplug. The research tried to identify the earplug, and studies how to turn them to be the potential factors for successful reception. In fact, these factors can originate from recipients themselves and the surrounding environment. While knowledge holders determine further advantages they will receive from the sharing of knowledge, such as monetary reward or reputation, advanced benefits may not be the major rationale for the reception. Researchers utilized the focus group (FG) methodology by engaging workers who had experience as knowledge recipients in their organizations. The FGs revealed possible factors causing people to believe or ignore incoming knowledge. The factors can be categorized into four groups based on the originator of the factors, which are, recipients themselves, senders, knowledge, and environmental factors. The recipients themselves can engender successful reception through factors such as their capacity to absorb the incoming knowledge, or their attitude towards senders. Senders' readiness and characteristics are also important. This research also suggested solutions that develop or enhance the effective reception environment in an organization. Management support is a crucial success factor. The support consists of 1) nurturing of collaborative culture in an organization, 2) provision of useful tools, spaces and infrastructure, 3) provision of adequate training for employees, and 4) provision of practice session.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to explore the phenomenon of acculturation in new product development (NPD) teams in a multicultural working environment. This paper provides recommendations for multinational companies (MNCs) in dealing with problems among team members from different cultures. Data were collected through 24 indepth interviews with local middlelevel managers (e.g. R&D, marketing managers) and expatriates working on NPD projects in MNC subsidiaries located in Thailand. A qualitative method was employed to explore and attain insightful information about the acculturation of local NPD members when working with expatriates. Results show that local NPD team members may acculturate themselves to foreign work culture when they have regular contact with expatriates during the product development process. The acculturation may also affect the team performance and the relationship among team members. Cultural training programs for local NPD team members are recommended. Since this qualitative pilot research has a rather small sample size of cases, it limits the ability to generalize the findings. The findings from MNCs subsidiaries may not represent all other cultures of MNCs operating in Thailand. The findings of this study significantly contribute to MNCs from North America and Asia that develop new products in Thailand. Cultural training programs and frequent and twoway communications are suggested to increase the familiarity of local employees with the foreign work culture, to develop mutual objectives, and to promote shared interests among multicultural NPD team members. This study extends the application of acculturation of local NPD team members within a multicultural setting, which has been rarely explored. Theoretically, the findings provide an indepth understanding of the local managers' acculturation pattern found in NPD teams. Also, it provides recommendations on how to support the local NPD team members more effectively in adopting critical values of the parent firm's culture so as to achieve NPD tasks facing less miscommunication and improving project performance. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Information Technology is often viewed as imposing too much standardization and limiting flexibility in New Product Development (NPD). This paper aims at understanding how the use of Product Lifecycle Management Technology (PLM) contributes to knowledge sharing in an international NPD environment. The research is based on a longitudinal case study of a consumer goods industry group and involved development teams in Europe and local suppliers in China. Knowledge transfer and translation were observed through the reduction of communication glitches among members and increased NPD work with Chinese suppliers. The results of the case study indicate that (1), with an important codification effort, the use of PLM technology resulted in higher data and network transparency and enhanced knowledge transfer; (2) PLM served as a particularly useful tool for knowledge translation especially for boundary spanners in their work relationships. While PLM can be considered the main mechanism for knowledge transfer in this context, the case suggests that knowledge translation requires a boundary spanner intervention and that, with the use of PLM, they reinforce each other. Particularly noteworthy was a positive shift in the boundary spanners' roles from the project leader to the outsourcing engineer. In turn, this unintended consequence reinforced their credibility and the legitimacy of the use of the system with the Chinese suppliers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The use of a relationship-based procurement method is promoted by many authors in the past few years. The construction industry is encouraged to adopt a relational contract in an effort to overcome its perceived problems prevailing in the industry. Despite a number of benefits proposed for the adoption of a relationship-based delivery method, the decision to select such a method should be made wisely, and clients should have adequate understanding about the strength and weakness of the method they intend to employ. There are several examples that incorrect selection of a procurement method resulted into value not delivered during the project and the outcomes were below of what it would have achieved by using a traditional type of delivery system. For this reason, this paper focuses on ECI procurement system as one of the relationship-based procurement methods. This paper aims at identifying and analysing the particular characteristics of ECI that attract clients to opt for using this method and analysing these drivers in more detail. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

But are they in fact related to employee performance? And if so, do they have the same strength and intensity as performance predictors? In this study, we used a Work Engagement Scale, commitment scale and employee performance measured through an almost real performance measure, where employees were asked to indicate the latest year's performance appraisal rating reported by their manager. Data analysed (N = 274 workers) first confirmed the existence of a positive relation between performance and effective commitment, normative commitment and work engagement with engagement showing a stronger association. Second, only work engagement was relevant to explain employee performance because commitment did not present significant predictor strength. An important implication of this study is that employers should assume the relevance of developing adequate and challenging work conditions, human resources practices and atmosphere so that employees can increase their passion for the work they are doing. Company leaders should self-address some related questions raised from this study: are some employees in the company engaged with their work but not committed to the organization?

While monitoring the vendor's performance is a common practice, insight into the status of the 'soft' aspects of the relationship, such as trust, is often not available, although research highlights the social aspects as a critical success factor. However, monitoring the softer facets' quality is difficult: Vendor managers track the status of the soft aspects, if at all, using survey tools among involved staff. This has shortcomings because it does not only capture subjective perceptions, but also interrupts the daily business of the participants. To develop a more objective instrument that collects data without interfering daily business, we draw on social network analysis. We suggest an approach that will eventually allow managers to monitor relationship quality in an efficient and objective way. The results suggest metrics to measure the soft factors of a relationship, such as trust and commitment.},

	abstract = {In this chapter the authors explore the relationship between Information Systems and Organization Development, highlighting the value that Holistic Change Interventions can introduce when applied to IS/IT areas, mobilizing Individuals, Groups and the whole Organization to promote Organizational Effectiveness. A "soft" approach to Organizational Change is proposed, focusing on main internal aspects which are determinant for Organizational Performance, including Organizational Culture and Values, Leadership, Work Teams, and Employee Engagement. The approach is illustrated by a successful "real-world" Transformational Change Program which has been developed, within an IT Unit of a major financial organization, following an Action Research paradigm. The intervention has integrated two main cycles - a first one covering the strategy determination and behavioral preparation for further action, and a second one devoted to a coordinated implementation of strategic actions which have emerged from the first cycle - where communication, engagement, action and improvement have been the most relevant attributes of the whole process. From a Research perspective this successful Change intervention has served to develop and test, within context, a Framework of Critical Success Factors for Holistic Change, which is described on its management implications, and covering distinct areas and dimensions. Also, the high potential of Action Research, to promote Holistic Change within real organizational settings, and, simultaneously, to address complex research issues, questions, objectives, and test hypothesis, is deeply illustrated within this chapter. © 2016 by IGI Global.

This book offers an early workbench model of incompetency training theory which proposes that executives and associates in firms, academia, and government organizations consciously as well as unknowingly offer incompetency training in many contexts. The evidence so far has shown that increasing trainees’ vigilance and ability to recognize exposure to incompetency-training may help trainees to decrease the effectiveness (impact) of exposures to incompetency training-advancing incompetency training theory and knowledge of incompetency training practice may be necessary conditions for remedying negative outcomes that follow from trainees receiving such training.

	abstract = {In a knowledge-based society, government organizations become more knowledge-intensive. Most governments which have not yet implemented effective knowledge management systems for government organizations have indicated concern about increasing the impact of knowledge sharing to promote the success of e-government implementation, and they have tried to determine what types of organizational social factors influence knowledge sharing among government employees. To provide insight into these concerns, this paper presents an empirical study of how major organizational social enabling factors influence knowledge sharing among employees by conducting surveys in a number of central government organizations that implement e-government strategies in Mongolia. The research model was analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) method. This study also investigates the mediating effects of knowledge sharing between the organizational social factors and employee performance with the moderating role of the e-government facilitating conditions. Leadership, reward and trust were revealed in this research as the components of the strongest foundation for knowledge sharing. The results also show that knowledge sharing plays a mediating role between these organizational social factors and performance. Moreover, this study finds that facilitating conditions play a key role as enablers of organizational performance improvements. These findings present important implications for policymakers to improve strategic planning for e-government implementation through investments that utilize the necessary facilitating conditions with sufficient knowledge sharing among employees of government so as to create a more conductive environment for improving organizational performance. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Such a relationship is investigated based on three key components: six antecedents of trust as independent variables (reputation, competence, integrity, communication, reciprocity, and contract), two types of trust as mediating variables (calculative and relative trust), and project success as a dependent variable. The results differentiate and compare the perceptions of trust for both owners and contractors in terms of their priority for antecedents of trust, the influential mechanism that connects trust with project success, and the numerical relationship between calculative trust and relational trust. For both parties, relational trust generates a higher impact on project success than calculative trust, but contractors perceived the relationship between relational trust and calculative trust as being linear while owners believed such a relationship is a quadratic function. This research provides new evidence to support the development of trust theory in the construction industry, and it can also help construction practitioners and policymakers to better understand the development and management of trust in the construction industry. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

From the vendor's perspective, we investigate the mediating role played by knowledge sharing in the success of offshore software development and identify factors that contribute to knowledge sharing in offshore software development. A survey method was used to collect data in China and validate the research model. Our findings confirm that knowledge sharing mediates the impact of the use of methodology and relationship with clients on the success of offshore software development projects; particularly, knowledge sharing has more impact on process efficiency than on product quality. This study contributes to the theoretical understandings on how development methodology and vendors' relationship with clients help overcome the challenges in off shoring software development OSD, and how knowledge sharing functions as a mediator between these factors and success of OSD. The findings also help vendors identify critical determinants of knowledge sharing in OSD and suggest strategies to execute OSD.},

Such changes may influence the demands and resources associated with a job. While research on burnout has addressed the role of exhaustion and job engagement using the Job Demands-Resources model, existing literature has focused on traditional work modes. This paper explores the effects on job demands and resources to understand the processes through which telework impacts the exhaustion and engagement of the teleworker. We find that the positive effect of telework revolves around reduced work pressure and role conflict and increased autonomy. The negative effect of telework is expressed through increased role ambiguity and reduced support and feedback. Overall, we find that telework is negatively related to both exhaustion and job engagement and that job demands and resources mediate these relationships. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Correlation and incremental regression analyses were run to draw the results. Findings: Results reveal that 24 percent of the variation in KSB is due to the changes in all the independent variables – intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, interpersonal trust, job involvement, job satisfaction and continuance commitment. The study also identifies job involvement and continuance commitment as strong determinants of knowledge sharing behavior among academics. Research limitations/implications: To facilitate knowledge sharing behavior among academics, management of the universities must provide the ways for improving the levels of job involvement, continuance commitment and job satisfaction.

This paper describes a successful case study in which useful tacit knowledge is captured from a knowledge cluster with the aim of innovating services provided by a consultancy organisation. To this end, a knowledge-management-based framework helps to capture useful tacit knowledge, from individuals in different locations by using two social software tools during the production of software. Findings reveal that the use of this framework empowers the continuous innovation of business processes, thus allowing consultancy organisations to provide high-quality solutions. Moreover, the framework allows newcomers to receive support from other colleagues and also mitigates the knowledge loss produced owing to the high rotation of personnel in such organisations. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The focus is on ways in which creative leadership has been applied in reforming a whole suite of programs within a large humanities/creative arts school, to facilitate students' preparation for working across disciplines, locations and cultures. Five disciplinary perspectives inspire creative leadership: creative arts; sociology; education; philosophy; and business. Synthesizing a wide range of literature and practice, a framework is suggested for leadership effectiveness with an overview of five leadership approaches. Discussion includes application of these approaches in the program reform project and what was learned in the process. Prompts or signposts are also proposed for learning and teaching leaders to help guide leadership practice in an integrated, holistic and creative way. Key reflections from the program reform project include: the importance of starting where disciplines and programs are, and ensuring ownership of the change being implemented; integrating change with familiar patterns and practices; and recognizing that change takes time, perseverance and resilience. Experience in the program reform project suggests that interdisciplinary thinking enhances education and its leadership. Furthermore, through transdisciplinary thinking and integrated scholarship, leadership practice and effectiveness can be transformed. © Common Ground, J. Fiona Peterson, All Rights Reserved.},

In the STBQ method, the WP is the basis for all planning, monitoring, controlling, and reporting on the project. It is also specifically designed with many features recommended by other researchers and intended to be integrated with the Advanced Work Packaging best practice developed by the Construction Industry Institute. The project engineer has two main responsibilities: interdisciplinary coordination and overall quality control. This paper describes how these responsibilities are fulfilled at the WP level.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at the relationships among factors which result in improved knowledge sharing, through the empirical validation of a theoretical model consisting of three dimensions: expected benefit in relation to knowledge sharing, trust at workplace, and employee knowledge-sharing behavior. Design/methodology/approach - This study targets three technological companies with a total of employees exceeding 1,500 (n=563), utilizing a survey questionnaire as the data collection instrument to test the relationship among the three dimensions. The structural equation modeling approach is used to test the proposed model. Findings - The results show that trust at workplace has a mediating effect on organizational knowledge-sharing behavior. It is also discovered that there is significant correlation between expected personal benefit through sharing knowledge and the development of trust at workplace. Originality/value - This study contributes empirical data to the predominantly theoretical literature by offering a deeper understanding of the mediating effect of trust on employee's expected benefit for the purpose of knowledge exchange behavior within teams and among teams. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leaders and co-workers in Swedish public sector organizations are exposed to demanding psychosocial working conditions; more knowledge about workplace-based interventions in this sector of working life is needed. OBJECTIVE: To compare co-workers' and leaders' self-ratings of health and psychosocial working conditions, and investigate how prevention and rehabilitation in Swedish public sector workplaces affects these ratings. METHOD: The longitudinal panel data consisted of 311 individuals (20 leaders, 291 co-workers) at 19 workplaces. Based on questionnaire data, statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U-Test, pair-wise Spearman correlations, a mixed between-within subjects ANOVA and Friedman's test. RESULTS: Results indicate differences in how the leaders and the co-workers judge their health and psychosocial working conditions. Leaders report work content that is more varied and interesting as well as more possibilities for personal development through work, yet they also report more tiredness, concern over managing their work situation and time pressure at work. Comparisons of mean values for used indicators show some improvements after one year, but also several non-significant or negative time trends two years after the interventions were initiated. CONCLUSION: The study provides some support for experienced differences between co-workers' and leaders' health and psychosocialworking conditions in public sectorworkplaces, indicating the importance of differentworkplace-oriented prevention and rehabilitation interventions for these two categories of employees. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

By constructing mixed-effects models from a large mid-1990s survey of U.S. steel employees, I find that team membership is linked to increased stress only when implemented in cultural contexts of conflict and distrust.

They can also have an adverse effect on an organisation's profitability, as additional work requires resources and time to rectify the error that has occurred. The reduction (i.e. measures designed to limit the occurrence of failures) and containment (i.e. measures designed to increase the detection and accelerate the recovery of errors) of design errors can therefore ameliorate organisational and project performance as well as improve safety. A systemic framework that classifies design error reduction and containment strategies according to people, organisation and project is propagated. It is suggested that when people, organisational and project strategies are implemented, incongruence then the propensity for design error reduction will significantly increase.

	abstract = {The business environment around the world is in a continuous evolution process due to changes in global dynamics. Even though the energy sector has relied much on the known sources, the production process has gone through some notable changes due to inherent challenges and developments in knowledge management and technology use. The Offshore oil & gas production industry today, at least in the North Sea, is at a crossroad where the traditional operational concepts are seriously challenged due to various risk factors and commercial uncertainties. Subsequently, 'Intergrated eOperations' (IO) was adapted as the business solution for a sustainable future seeking major benefits by major players in the sector. This has begun to re-engineer the traditional practices and commercial operations, and the industry continuously seeks novel solutions for 24/7 online real-time operations. In this unique 'eBusiness' environment, SMEs encounter various technical and operational challenges to cope with the mass scale dynamic change process. In order to utilize IO for commercial advantage, SMEs are in the process of exploring various interface solutions today. With respect to the ongoing developments and the scopes of IO, 'Collaborative business interfacing' that is discussed in this chapter is to enable the SMEs to be 'smarter together' to capitalize on the potentials of IO through a strategic capability acquisition process. In the IO setting, and the eBusiness environment that it is expected to create, strategic business change is not an option for SMEs but an inevitable issue for survival and growth. © 2013, IGI Global.},

At present Halal assurance is in a complicated state, with various Halal standards differing from each other without gaining mutual acceptance. The world is starting to understand the need for an influential globally accepted standard that would open doors to global markets and gain consumer confidence. This paper discusses issues mainly related to food safety in Halal assurance. The aim was to discover and describe the approach to food safety requirements in Halal food provision and how this is incorporated in the Halal assurance systems. The position of food safety regulation within Halal requirements or Halal standards' requirements for food safety is still unclear. This review also considers whether current Halal standards include criteria in common with internationally accepted food hygiene standards and emphasizes the potential of using the HACCP system for Halal assurance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper employs the learning organisation culture model developed by Watkins & Marsick (1993, 1999) as its conceptual framework. Thus, the study analyses the effects of seven independent dimensions of the model and two performance variables, viz., knowledge performance and financial performance using mixed methods research. The qualitative analysis employs in-depth interviews with 18 women staff members who were nominated and selected for a national-level UGC program on "Capacity building of women managers in higher education institutions." The decoded data is summarised after constant comparative analysis. It is inferred that Indian institutions of higher education are yet to become truly learning organisations. Similarly, the quantitative analysis relies on empirical data with a sample of 150 women faculty members from ten different institutions in order to determine the association between the variables. It is evident from the findings of the factor analysis that there are five factors that determine the association between organisational learning culture and the two performance variables, viz., knowledge performance and financial performance. © 2014, Research Institute of Asian Women.

Interviews with middle managers and an examination of documentation about prevention and rehabilitation interventions at the workplaces made it possible to group the workplaces in two workplace program groups - high versus low quality workplace-based prevention and rehabilitation programs. Statistical methods used were reliability tests, correlation analyses and t tests. Results indicate significant associations between changes in employee-judged stress and psychosocial working conditions, and changes in employee-judged health. The results concerning changes in employees' health, stress and psychosocial working conditions (after workplace-based programs) showed significant differences between workplaces with high quality workplace-based programs compared with workplaces with low quality workplace-based programs, with the former having more favourable results. The study indicates that workplace-based prevention and rehabilitation programs with a broad change strategy and high levels of management and employee involvement can apply to small public sector workplaces. © The Author(s) 2014.},

Innovation intermediaries operate as middle-men between solution seekers (companies seeking technological knowledge for solving their problems) and problem solvers (experts with specialized knowledge and solutions); thus, they help to connect suppliers and customers of technological knowledge. To be successful, intermediaries need to understand the solution seeker's problem and reach to their networks of contacts or connections with various experts to match the right expert to the right problem. The literature indicates that there are two different focuses in social capital, i.e., bridging (or broadening of the network) and bonding (or deepening of the relationship). In this study, a research model and hypotheses are developed to investigate the relationship between social capital and outcomes of intermediary process. The hypotheses are tested with the data from a government-sponsored intermediary organization in Thailand, called iTAP. The findings support the synergistic view of social capital which indicates that both bonding and bridging are necessary for the intermediation process to be successful. © 2013 PICMET.},

	abstract = {Johan Sverdrup is one of the five largest oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), and will be one of the most prominent industrial projects in Norway during the next 50 years. The field will comc on stream at the end of 2019 and create enormous value. The resource estimate is between 1.9-3.0 billion barrels of oil equivalents. Drilling operations started with predrilling of eight producers in March 2016. Due to challenging market conditions it was recognized early in the project planning phase that a step change in efficiency was needed. This paper presents the aggressive goals that were set, the overall strategy brought to play to reach the ambitious goals and key new innovative work practices. The Eight Wells Drilling Campaign has been recognized as very successful in all aspects, and was completed eight months ahead of schedule. The paper describes how a trilateral partnership, consisting of the Operator, the Drilling Contractor and the Main Provider of Drilling & Well Services, together reached aggressive targets for tangible efficiency gains. Important success-factors and new work practices are described, which include key elements such as long-Term and comprehensive contracts, integrated operations, integrated services and a new incentive system. Equally important is the development and implementation of a shared vision and shared priorities. Furthermore, the paper describes how demands from a challenging customer were operationalized, and created engagement and motivation across companies. The development of a joint operating model clarified roles, responsibilities, expectations, understandings and ensured that the same message was given to all. An aligned leadership cooperation both offshore and onshore was identified as important. Technically well- equipped operation rooms offshore and onshore allowing real-Time collaboration, video-conferencing and real-Time sharing of information across geographical and company boundaries were seen as key enablcrs. Furthermore, important for the radical efficiency improvements was fast and efficient decision processes made possible by the delegation of operational decision making power to a joint operations team lead by the Operating Company. © 2017, Offshore Technology Conference.},

CoPs are informal relational structures that connect people for the purpose of sharing expertise and experience. In spite of the wide proliferation of CoPs in diverse organisation, the factors leading to effective knowledge sharing in CoPs are still not well understood. Plus, empirical studies are still rare. Therefore, this paper presents a research model that defines the critical factors determining knowledge sharing in CoPs. The contribution of community member motivation and trust to successful knowledge sharing in CoPs is investigated. Plus, the moderating roles of management support and team culture are examined in relation to member motivation and trust for knowledge sharing. Based on extensive survey data from Korean multinational companies, the empirical results show that motivation and trust have an active influence on the knowledge sharing process in CoPs. The roles of management support and team culture are also discussed, along with the theoretical and managerial implications. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The capability to overcome tradeoffs among costs, quality and time has become a must in high-margin businesses too. Lean thinking may be a solution, but applications in the luxury-fashion market are still rare. In order to shed light on this apparent contradiction, the purpose of this paper is to identify the key features of the luxury-fashion market that may act as barriers for the adoption of lean principles. Next, based on the results of this preliminary analysis, the paper tries to verify, if and how, lean principles can be properly reinterpreted, so as to properly fit the requirements of this market. Design/methodology/approach – Due to the operating nature of lean, an empiric approach was followed. From the evidences gathered during a lean project of a world-wide company, critical elements of the luxury-fashion market were identified and used as criteria to select, among lean tools, the most appropriate ones. Lastly, selected tools were integrated in a structured framework (for lean implementation) that was used to analyze and to improve many logistics and manufacturing processes. Findings – Developed solutions were implemented as pilot projects, with outstanding preliminary result. Results are case specific and trying to infer general considerations may be hazardous. Nonetheless, due to the relevant dimension of the project, they can be considered more than a clue concerning the robustness of the framework and, most of all, concerning the real potentialities of lean in the luxury-fashion market. Practical implications – The framework is extremely operational and, together with the proposed industrial cases, can be used as a guideline to support practitioners during the implementation of similar projects. Originality/value – Lean thinking is relatively new in the luxury-fashion market, where the focus on operational costs has been traditionally considered as a marginal issue. Thus, the application of lean principles in this market is the innovative element of the paper. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Collaborations can attract resources, increase efficiency, and facilitate visions of mutual benefit that can ignite common desires of partners to work across and within sectors. An important question remains: How to enable successful collaboration? Inter-Organizational Collaboration by Design examines how these types of collaborations can overcome barriers to innovate and rejuvenate communities outlining the factors and antecedents that influence successful collaboration. The book proposes a theoretical perspective for collaborators to adopt design science (a solution finding approach utilizing end-user-centered research, prototyping, and collective creativity to strengthen individuals, teams, and organizations), the language of designers, and a design attitude as an empirically informed pathway for better managing the complexities inherent in collaboration. Through an integrated framework, evidence-based tools and strategies for building successful collaboration is articulated where successful collaboration performance facilitates innovation and rejuvenation.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a survey method for collecting data from 204 respondents from the sample organization. The data were statistically analyzed and interpretations were made. Findings: The study reveals that the sample organization scores high on the various learning organization dimensions (seven dimensions of DLOQ), which in turn impact knowledge performance and financial performance. Learning organization practices and processes are prevalent in the sample organization and it is progressing well toward its vision of becoming a learning organization (mentioned in its HR vision). Research limitations/implications: The data for the study were collected from a single sample organization. Hence, any sweeping generalization of the results needs to be made with caution.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we provide first evidence that the difference between the actual and desired amount of working hours in paid employment is positively related to the propensity to switch to self-employment. Furthermore, our analysis supports the hypothesis that employees who perceive their current wage level as very unfair are more likely to have higher entrepreneurial intentions. However, the closer actual wages get to the wage levels perceived as fair, the more employees are likely to remain in their current employment situation. We also tested the interaction effect of working time preferences and fair wage perceptions. In line with our theoretical considerations, we find that employees who perceive their wages as unfair and, simultaneously, prefer different work hours have the strongest entrepreneurial intentions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe the knowledge management (KM) loop process in a work package (WP)-based project engineering management method. The purpose of the KM loop is the routine capture of learnings to improve work practices in both the project and the firm. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model for a project KM loop is developed by researching various KM theories found in the literature and incorporating the most applicable concepts and bridging any gaps in an attempt to overcome the reported impediments to learning in projects. A specific WP-based project engineering method (the STBQ method) is chosen as the framework for illustrating the workings and advantages of the KM loop. The author’s experiential judgement is used in applying selected academic concepts to create a KM process particularly useful for consulting engineering firms engaged in the detailed design phase of heavy industrial projects notwithstanding the fact that it may be beneficial in other project environments. Findings: Completion of a WP can be used as a natural point in time for the collection of lessons learned (LL). At post-WP debriefing meetings, intuitive learnings can be contributed by individuals and interpreted in the context of the recently completed WP. When seen to be applicable, the project engineer integrates this newly gained experiential knowledge into the project’s job instructions for immediate implementation on other WPs remaining in the project scope. Through the project manager, these new or revised job instructions are proposed as candidates for new or revised standard practices to the senior managers of the engineering firm who can institutionalize them by approval for use in other in-progress or future projects. Research limitations/implications: The KM loop described here is specifically intended to be used with the STBQ method where the 100 per cent rule is applied and where each WP sub-team is tasked with the delivery of their WP safely, on-time, on-budget and with no quality deficiencies as the criteria for success of their WP. A research limitation is that capturing learnings throughout the project does not solve the problem of capturing post-project learnings from design errors surfacing during construction, in commissioning, or after start-up during on-going operations and maintenance. Nonetheless, innovative ideas and improvements can be found during the detailed engineering phase and the KM loop captures these for intra-project and inter-project use. Practical implications: The extra effort of decomposing requirements into WPs not only helps control project costs, schedule, quality and safety but also provides an effective way to capture knowledge from project learnings for intra-project and inter-project use. Social implications: The lessons-learned sessions held at the completion of each WP provides an opportunity to provide motivation and morale boosting to the WP sub-team members. Originality/value: This paper contributes what is believed to be the first WP-based KM loop in project engineering management using a specific application of the 4I framework of organizational learning. In addition, when applied in the STBQ method or any other method that uses interim WPs for both planning and reporting, the LL sessions can be pre-scheduled and budgeted separately from the subject WP. This helps to overcome the problem widely reported in projects that not enough calendar time or person-hours can be spared to attend the LL sessions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to test and compare two models, which have been popularly used for explaining how users come to accept and use a technology and their behavioral intention. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) is used to analyze customer intention to buy online. By sampling 102 online potential customers in Malaysia, findings indicate that the TRA and TAM are valid models in the prediction of the intention to buy online. Attitude, subjective norm, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were found to be positively related to purchase intention, with attitude being the more influential predictor. TRA was found to be a better predictor in comparison to the TAM. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to organizations that sell their products on the Internet.

With the key finding that the influence of informal controls and interorganizational learning on formal controls changes over time, this research helps expand the domain of control dynamics in global IS projects.

We propose and test a model wherein trust, based on partner reliability, is constrained to the IOR exchange context where it develops and does not generalize to other contexts. Distrust, rooted in value incongruence, more readily generalizes across exchange contexts. Results support these predictions. In addition, our analysis shows that trust and distrust combine such that managers decrease their preferences for highly specific focal-context contracts only when in-context trust is high and distrust is low. We discuss how these findings may provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between trust-based and contract-based IOR governance. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

After this consideration of theoretical constructs, we turn to an examination of the empirical findings in research studies associated with K-12 school contexts, government organizations, corporations, and the health care industry. Our findings indicate three core ideas central to change agentry: (1) connecting an organization to its environment is important, (2) flexibly adaptive change may be a desired goal, and (3) local leaders as well as external supports are needed to support any successful change effort. © 2008 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Conceptually, it extends this line of research by reframing trustworthiness as a hierarchical, reflective construct, incorporating ability, benevolence, integrity, and predictability. Empirically, it confirms that partial least squares path modeling can be used to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical, reflective model with moderating and mediating effects in a nomological network. The model shows that trustworthiness is a second-order, reflective construct that has a significant direct and indirect impact on continuance intentions in the context of mHealth information services. It also confirms that consumer trust plays the key, mediating role between trustworthiness and continuance intentions, while trustworthiness does not have any moderating influence in the relationship between consumer trust and continuance intentions. Overall, the authors conclude by discussing conceptual contributions, methodological implications, limitations, and future research directions of the study. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

Data were generated from a questionnaire survey of 427 middle managers from 194 MSC-status companies operating in Malaysia. Although the IT companies are highly aware of the importance of KM, the factors were only moderately implemented, with the exclusion of removal of organisational constraints. Some significant interactions were found between the KM success factors and organisational performance. Such significant findings provide important information on whether the MSC-status companies perceived KM as important to their success. In addition, based on the empirical results, recommendations are made on how the companies could improve their performance by narrowing the gaps through better organising their KM practices from the right perspective. This paper provides new information not only in terms of filling the gap of the newness of KM practices in Malaysia, it also has implications on the relationships between KM success factors and the performance of the MSC-status IT organisations in Malaysia. © 2006 iKMS & World Scientific Publishing Co.},

Even though the energy sector has relied much on the known sources, the production process has gone through some notable changes due to inherent challenges and developments in knowledge management and technology use. The Offshore oil & gas production industry today, at least in the North Sea, is at a cross-road where the traditional operational concepts are seriously challenged due to various risk factors and commercial uncertainties. Subsequently, 'Intergrated eOperations' (IO) was adapted as the business solution for a sustainable future seeking major benefits by major players in the sector. This has begun to re-engineer the traditional practices and commercial operations, and the industry continuously seeks novel solutions for 24/7 online real-time operations. In this unique 'eBusiness' environment, SMEs encounter various technical and operational challenges to cope with the mass scale dynamic change process. In order to utilize IO for commercial advantage, SMEs are in the process of exploring various interface solutions today. With respect to the ongoing developments and the scopes of IO, 'Collaborative business interfacing' that is discussed in this chapter is to enable the SMEs to be 'smarter together' to capitalize on the potentials of IO through a strategic capability acquisition process. In the IO setting, and the eBusiness environment that it is expected to create, strategic business change is not an option for SMEs but an inevitable issue for survival and growth. © 2011, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {The unique challenges posed by deepwater wells of ever-increasing complexity continue to force operators and service companies to explore new and innovative well delivery solutions. In early 2002, Shell Exploration and Production Americas took an important step towards well performance optimization with the initiation of a pilot study into real-time, remote monitoring of exploration and production wells in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Starting with a small-scale "war room" concept with limited scope, the pilot quickly grew into the current New Orleans-based "Real-Time Operations Center" (RTOC), which monitors all offshore wells in the GoM as well as major exploration wells globally. Main objectives of this multidisciplinary collaboration center are to enable more pro-active well planning and improve well execution by reducing non-productive time (NPT) and invisible lost time (ILT). The success of the RTOC, as well as that of other independent well visualization and monitoring pilots in the Shell Group, has meanwhile led to significant steps towards global expansion and coverage. In a follow-up to earlier papers1,2, we describe the current state-of-the-art in real-time operations monitoring technology deployment in the RTOC, and how it has evolved from the original pilot phase. We discuss the center's various activities, demonstrate how they add value and how this value is being measured. Key hurdles and success factors for implementation of an operations center are summarized. Moreover, the preliminary learnings from global deployment are shared. The information may serve as a blueprint for the planning, design and operation of a real-time operations center both locally, regionally and globally. The expansion of real time engineering and monitoring services across the globe is a challenging and pioneering undertaking. Consequently, we hope that this paper will help to lead the way in expanding this capability in the oil and gas industry in general. Copyright 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {Recently, the petroleum industry has capitalized on remarkable information and collaboration technologies that bring vast amount of real-time data to the decision-makers. The goal is to improve their decision-making processes by integrating technology, people, work processes, and organizations. However, complexity of drilling operations and investment costs put industry in quest for a feasible method to valuate benefits. The prevailing evaluation methods are usually restricted to qualitative approaches, and thus are inefficient as decision aids. The paper presents a decision analytic approach to quantitative valuation of integrated operations. The proposed valuation method is illustrated by a case from improving decisions' quality in drilling operations in the North Sea. Improving the quality of operational decisions requires the drilling team to have access to the relevant information in a timely manner. The relevant information needs to be filtered, aggregated, and fused into decisions; and correspondingly represented to the decision-maker. Availability of new information allows making new decisions, and changing work processes. Adoption of a new tool, conformance to a new work process and trust in aggregated and shared information are typically critical success factors. The method is designed to qualitatively analyze changes in intangible capital and assess technology adoption under conditions of operational and economical uncertainties. The method accounts for information quality improvements and related uncertainties management. In turn, decision analytical part of the method provides a means to relate observable improvements in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and uncertainties. Operational decisions are formalized using influence diagram, a.k.a. Bayesian decision network. Implementation of digital fields and integrated operations is technologically and organizationally challenging. The functional steps of the established methodology and the decision analytic approach are significant contributions to understanding the quantitative value of these projects. © 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

During the period 2004-2007, the videophone network was used for different types of teleconsultation (orthopaedics, psychiatry, diabetes, rehabilitation), continuing education and various patient care and administrative meetings. Qualitative research with observation and interviews with 30 professionals (physicians, nurses, psychiatric nurses, physiotherapists) was carried out in early 2007 to find out health-care professionals' attitudes toward telehealth and to see how the attitudes were connected to telehealth usage. Overall, the attitudes were more positive than negative, ranging from negative to enthusiastically positive. Diversity of attitudes occurred in relation to time, situation, profession, health centre and telehealth application. Ten different types of telehealth adopters were recognized: enthusiastic user, positive user, critical user, hesitant user, positive participant, hesitant participant, critical participant, neutral participant, negative participant and positive non-participant. Telehealth was especially well accepted in continuing education and in diabetes teleconsultations. The study showed that a negative attitude was not a definite barrier to telehealth adoption, but it did require additional attention from project workers and managers. Project staff and managers need to take into account the diverse attitudes of health professionals, because different people require different actions to adopt telehealth in their work.},

To develop and maintain a healthier life-style is not an easy task to succeed with, it involves being able to change everyday situations. E-health communities can assist in this process through continuous interactions between community members. However, whether these e-health communities actively support learning depends on the ways they help community members reflect upon their habits, underlying reasons and motivational factors.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate and compare the managerial perceptions on the similarities and differences in the FEI concepts between software industry and the traditional industrial sector. Design/methodology/approach - The research approach of this paper can be categorized as a case study. Causal cognitive maps are used as graphic tools for collecting and analyzing the perceptions of selected experts about the concepts of FEI, and for recognizing the perceived interrelationships between these concepts. Findings - The paper presents the similarities and differences in the FEI concepts between the two industries. The most similarly assessed concept is that the quality of a product or software development project can be most often influenced by successful execution of detailed customer needs analysis. Research limitations/implications - The selection of a purely academic interview group representing the traditional industrial sector has some limitations. Practical implications - This paper provides viewpoints to managers and project team members on the most important factors in their front-end activities influencing the success of product or software development projects. Originality/value - The intersection between FEI and RE and its handling by causal cognitive mapping is a novel territory in academic research. In addition, this paper opens up a new strand for academic discussion by connecting these two domains previously unconnected in literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In answering the question of how e-business customers develop initial trust especially in unknown online retailers, we propose a model with a two-factor initial trust model (competence and goodwill) and three different types of predictors:two trustee's characteristic-based factors (company profile and website quality), one institution-based factor (third-party support) and one trustor's personality-based factor (propensity to trust). This model was empirically tested and we found some evidence that website quality and third-party support had significant effect on initial trust. Company profile and propensity to trust didn't have any direct effects on initial trust, but a type of propensity to trust showed some moderating effects. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

In fact, the reign over time is a crucial element in controlling the labor process. Yet a lack of cultural studies covering different approaches to this issue remains-particularly those focusing on high-skilled salaried workers. This article is a small attempt to fill this gap, based on an analysis of unstructured qualitative interviews with high-tech professionals from a B2B software company. It focuses on the issue of timing in IT projects, as perceived by software engineers. The findings indicate that managerial interruptions in work play an important part in the social construction of delays. However, interruptions from peer software engineers are not perceived as disruptive. This leads to the conclusion that time is used in a symbolic way, both for organizational domination and solidarity rituals. The use of time as a symbolic currency in knowledge-work rites is presented as often influencing the very process of labor and schedules. It is revealed to be the dominant evaluation factor, replacing the officially used measures, such as efficiency, or quality. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research develops and investigates the concept of reciprocal trust between interacting teams. Reciprocal trust is defined as the trust that results when a party observes the actions of another and reconsiders one's trust-related attitudes and subsequent behaviors based on those observations. Twenty-four teams of systems analysis and design students were involved in a 6-week controlled field study focused on the development of an information systems project. Each team was responsible for both developing a system (development role) and for supervising the development of a system by another team (management role). Risk-taking actions exhibited by one team in an interacting pair were found to predict the other team's trustworthiness perceptions and subsequent trust. The level of trust formed in turn predicted the team's subsequent risk-taking behaviors with respect to the other team. This pattern of reciprocal trust repeated itself as the teams continued to interact over the duration of the project, thus supporting our model of reciprocal trust. Findings also indicate that trust and trust formation can occur at the team level. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Information systems development (ISD) is a complex process involving interconnected resources, stake holders, and outcomes. Understanding factors contributing to ISD success has attracted keen interest from both researchers and practitioners, and many research studies have been published in this area. However, most studies focus on one or two factors affecting ISD success. A holistic view of factors impacting ISD success is missing. This paper synthesizes past research on the topic and proposes a unified model on ISD success through a systematic and comprehensive literature review. The unified model highlights that ISD is a complex and interactive process involving individual, team, and organization factors, as well as ISD methodology. These factors impact the ISD process as well as its success.Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Purpose : Based on theories of organizational learning and strategy, the purpose of this study is to develop a strategic contingency model to identify the interrelationships among knowledge characteristics, knowledge management (KM) strategy, knowledge integration, organizational learning, KM capability and innovation. Design/methodology/approach : This study was conducted using the survey method. A total of 800 survey questionnaires were sent to KM managers from the semiconductor, LED, precision machinery, communication, and biotech industries. ANOVA and LISREL were adopted to test 11 hypotheses as developed in this study. Findings : The research results concluded that: knowledge characteristics with higher modularity and explicitness could enhance organizational learning and knowledge integration; levels of organizational learning, knowledge integration, and KM capability had significant impact on a firm's innovation; the interaction effects of human oriented KM strategy and organizational learning, and system oriented KM strategy and knowledge integration were found to significantly impact KM capability. Research limitations/implications : To further confirm the results of this cross-sectional research, more longitudinal research is suggested. To identify the scope of generalization of this study, future research may use the same questionnaire or an abbreviated one to conduct surveys across different industries or different international settings. Originality/value : The interrelationships among knowledge characteristics, KM capability and innovation have been evaluated extensively in previous studies. However, the interaction effects between organizational learning and KM strategy and between system oriented KM strategy and knowledge integration on KM capability have been largely ignored. The results of this study provide very important references for academics and practitioners to implement the effectiveness of KM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Results support most of the hypotheses. Interestingly, the results of the comparison between Chinese and US bornglobals are consistent with the "convergence" perspective.

	abstract = {Purpose: Concurrent designing of products, processes and supply chains (three-dimensional concurrent engineering (3-DCE)) has proved to be beneficial in rendering holistic, market-responsive architecture to organizations through linkages created by dynamic capability development and innovation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the promises of 3-DCE in synthesizing and sustaining critical success factors (CSFs) for organizations, and also to underpin the existing gap between its offerings in devising the CSFs and the "real solutions" essential in a dynamic system's perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an intermediary approach combining both explanatory and exploratory researches. The conceptual framework of the paper is based on a matrix for organizational mapping of textile, clothing and fashion (TCF) firms prepared through content analysis. This is followed by an extensive semi-structured survey. The selection of firms was based on contacting TEKO and Europages. Usable responses were obtained from 42 firms for detailed analysis, making the response rate around 15 percent. Findings: The results were manifold. It showed that most of the key success factors are synthesized and sustained through 3-DCE designing. The paper also highlights the necessity of incorporating intangible value propositions of culture, leadership and governance, knowledge, image and relationship into the 3-DCE model to generate an "extended 3-DCE" framework for mediating operational performance and hence organizational success. Such a model required in a dynamic environment is argued to show a fit to represent a design for resilience perspective, requiring further research. Research limitations/implications: First, the selection of sample size of organizations was small and arguments regarding its representation of the Swedish TCF firms' population could be raised. So the claims and propositions of the paper cannot be widely generalized. Second, the responses to the survey were based on judgments of the company top management and could vary if intra-organizational responses were considered. Practical implications: The findings from the paper can be beneficial for organizations to understand the key areas in which to invest and how to invest their resources and time, as CSF identification is largely qualitative and can result in differing opinions in pinpointing them. It is thus recommended to synthesize or identify them from the 3-DCE perspective. Originality/value: The paper is original in realizing how 3-DCE can be instrumental in devising CSFs in organizations and also what factors needs to be incorporated into its "extended" framework to match the requirements for organizations in a dynamic environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to provide a timely review of developments to the theory of constraints (TOC) body of knowledge, particularly the TOC thinking processes as reported in the public domain peer-reviewed literature, and to present an analysis of the nature of the thinking processes (TPs), and their methodological and applicatory evolution. Design/methodology/approach - Research reported in the public domain from 1994 to early 2006, as peer-reviewed journal articles or as papers published in refereed conference proceedings, was reviewed to summarize key research issues that have been studied and to suggest future research. The literature is categorized along several dimensions and according to several emergent and self-defined clusters that relate to application area, methodology and epistemology. Findings - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the TP literature, identifies specific publication and research gaps as they relate to the defined classification and also provides some future research topics. Research limitations/implications - The review addresses only the peer-reviewed literature spanning a limited period from 1994 to the time of the current work in early 2006 - that is the period since the publication of Goldratt's It's Not Luck. In doing so, the review complements the work of others for the period to 2000, extends previous reviews beyond 2000, whilst providing an additional focus on the TPs. Practical implications - This paper provides useful insights about the development of the TOC body of knowledge, especially as it relates to the development and reported use of the TPs as stand-alone tools or in tandem with other tools or methods. It provides a valuable summary, for academics and practitioners, of the developing TOC body of knowledge that has been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Originality/value - The development of the TOC body of knowledge has been largely practice-led, manifested not only in the diverse nature of application areas and in the diverse use of TOC tools, but also in the broader evolution of TOC methodology, methods and tools. Earlier reviews of the literature in this journal preceded many of the developments documented here. This paper will help position the many TOC methods and tools in relation to one another, as well as capturing developments in multi-methodological usage across several domains. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

A scale was designed in this work which attempted to reflect the different learning sub-constructs collected from the literature, as well as the learning process' particularities in the SMSC being studied here. The effects of learning ability are linked to the intensity and degree of product innovation novelty in SMSC and the quality of their own commercialised products. These two variables' repercussion on the business results achieved by SMSC are then analysed in relation to their main competitors. An attempt is thus made to go deeper into understanding how competitive advantages are generated in organisations. The study's results confirmed the expected effects of learning on the rhythm of innovations being commercialised in SMSC and on the quality of their supply. It also highlights these variables' great repercussion on the financial and market result indicators considered in this study.},

	abstract = {Today, the self-governing schools (SGS) have become a global phenomenon. It has liberated school heads from the bureaucratic shackles, making them leaders in their own right. Accordingly, the principal's role has undergone the most radical transformation and has been widely acknowledged as the vanguard of stability and the agent of change in creating effective schools. As the CEO, the principal has to develop a shared vision with the capacity to incorporate diverse leadership styles such as Transformational, Distributed, Shared and Strategic. Under the SGS model the governing body formulates school policies in consultation with the principal, making him/her responsible and accountable for implementation. However, to face the new challenges posed by the SGS model (otherwise known as Site-based/School-based management (SBM) and Local management of schools (LMS)), it has become imperative that school leaders undergo further professional development in leadership and management. This is evidenced by recent research conducted in countries such as the USA, China, Australia, Japan, Sweden, Thailand and the Philippines. This book is the culmination of the author's 34 years of research, administrative and academic experience in guiding, educating and training both aspiring and practicing educational/school leaders from around the world. It is a cutting edge response to the widely acknowledged need for further professional development in school leadership. © 2006 Springer. All rights reserved.},

By examining path-breaking innovation processes through in-depth analysis of several large-scale initiatives around the world, the authors explore how profound changes in product, process, and service can be explained and managed, and consider the practical implications for scientific, organizational, institutional, and political leaders concerned with channeling innovation toward economic growth.

It appeared that COS is explained by national identity and the particular benefits of working toward the organization of the Olympic Games. Whether they are satisfied with the job, and their levels of organizational identity do not affect their commitment to the event.

The analysis of the existing IS literature reveals limitations concerning prior conceptualizations of culture and cultural differences and provides ideas for future research on the effect of cultural differences as well as cultural, relationship, knowledge, and project management techniques. In particular, the existing literature can be grouped into formal and informal mechanisms as well as learning issues.

As a result, there are still a large number of information technology (IT) organizations that have not yet implemented any object-oriented (OO) process. For them, the transition to a new work environment and the adoption and utilization of a software process implies a number of problems, commonly including necessary human and organizational resistance to the ensuing cultural change. This chapter provides IT organizations and professionals with insights into the most important key success factors that may promote the entire process of organizational change. We investigate the effect of various human factors on the adoption and diffusion of an object-oriented software development process. Some of the human factors include motivation, leadership, resistance to culture change, and willingness and readiness to change. In addition, this chapter explores the significant role of these factors in controlling the entire process of implementing an OO process in practice, emphasizing the significance of planning and managing these "soft" factors to achieve clear advantages and gain enviable results. © 2006, Idea Group Inc.},

The evaluation of special events has tended to focus on measuring the economic benefits that festivals can deliver to local economies. However, scant attention has been paid to the indirect impacts of arts events on communities and in particular to the impacts felt by the artists who participate. The Fringe festival plays a critical role as a facilitator of new work dedicated to creating opportunities for artists to practice their craft. Our research findings suggest that the stated goals of the Fringe - to provide a multi-artform and inclusive platform for the presentation of art works through the provision of resources and other services to artists - are largely being met, and that participating artists report a high degree of satisfaction with the work of the organisation. In terms of impact, the research finds that artists see themselves as the beneficiaries of a number of positive short-term outcomes resulting from their participation in the festival. We call for further longitudinal study to address the potential long-term career development impacts of festival participation for artists. © Common Ground, Hilary Glow, Jo Caust, All Rights Reserved.},

A theoretical framework relating structural and contextual factors to interpersonal trust and project outcomes was built, including task complexity as a moderating variable. Hypotheses from this model were tested with data on 93 product development projects carried out in Turkey. The findings showed that structural factors such as moderate level of demographic diversity, proximity of team members, team longevity, and contextual factors (procedural and interactional justices) were positively related to the development of interpersonal trust in NPD teams. The findings also revealed that interpersonal trust had an impact on team learning and new product success, but not on speed-to-market. Further, the findings showed that the impact of interpersonal trust on team learning and new product success was higher when there was higher task complexity. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The present study investigates perceived success and how it is related to corporate finance professionals' information source use behavior based on a Web survey of 92 Finnish corporate finance professionals. The principal finding of the statistical analysis of the data is that perceptions of work success and specific types of information sources contributing to the success are related. The correlations are complex, and very different types of information sources contribute to individual types of success, and vice versa. The findings indicate that information sources function as measures of success and serve an instrumental purpose. Besides functional relations, the correlation of the variables suggests more comprehensive success and information source use related dependencies and preferences. The findings imply that by studying existing perceptions of success, it is possible to make inferences about preferred information sources. The study also suggests that both personal and organizational perceptions of success should be taken into account when planning information services and information literacy education for corporate finance professionals to increase their effectiveness and relevance for the professionals. © 2010 ASIS&T.},

However, due to the increasing involvement of multiple vendors within a global ISD project, the topic becomes vital. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to analyze how and through which factors vendor-vendor knowledge transfer is shaped. As research on this topic is scarce, we applied an exploratory in-depth single-case study as research approach. The case comprises a global ISD project initiated by a large German bank involving several globally distributed vendors. For data collection and analysis, techniques from grounded theory method were adopted. The analysis of our case suggests that knowledge transfer between vendors runs through four stages and is influenced through various factors relating to certain characteristics of the knowledge receiver, the structure of the knowledge to be transferred and organizational characteristics of the involved parties. The paper concludes by offering theoretical and practical implications.},

	abstract = {Today, the microelectronic industry is faced with considerable challenges to renew its products and to make production outputs more reliable. For this reason, experiments in new manufacturing processes are essential and must take into account the vulnerability of used procedures. Knowledge produced during the execution of experiments constitutes an invaluable element of productivity. However, formalism is missing for the process and knowledge management of these successive experiments. In particular, an experiment's return of experience, an exchange between processes and a capitalization of knowledge in time to initiate a later reuse are all primary success factors to increase the experiment productivity, but are often badly understood and insufficiently supported. Knowledge Management is not integrated into the experiment process management, and a reuse of existing experiments or information centralization for a process is difficult to achieve. Consequently, this thesis proposes a new analysis method, called PIFA (Process, Information, Functionality, Analyze), for the management of knowledge and processes. This method is composed of three levels: The Process level helps to capture the process flow (dependencies between actions), the Information level helps in capturing the information flow to improve the information sharing within a process and between processes, and the Functionality level guarantees that the involved actor has an immediate surplus value and will accept the changes implemented in the introduction of a new work methodology, such as higher information capitalization. In this work, the PIFA approach was applied in the context of experiment processes at STMicroelectronics. Based on the results, an IT-Tool (EMA - Experiment Management Application) was designed in order to support the execution of these processes, capitalize produced knowledge during the execution, and initiate knowledge reuse. After a test phase, the tool was deployed in June and it is currently used by 300 employees.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes how employees' perceptions of organizational context and IT affect employee knowledge acquisition and application capabilities in five public and five private sector organizations in South Korea. It discusses the results of regression analyses based on a survey of 322 public and private employees that explored their perceptions of organizational vision and goals, social networks, centralization, performance-based reward systems, the usage of IT applications, and knowledge acquisition and application capabilities. Findings The results of a survey of public and private employees show that clear organizational vision and goals, social networks, and employee usage of IT applications are all positively associated with high levels of employee knowledge acquisition and application capabilities. Centralization, however, was negatively associated with employee knowledge acquisition and application capabilities. Social network and IT application utilization were both positively associated with public employees' knowledge acquisition and application capabilities. Performance-based reward systems were positively associated with private employees' knowledge application capabilities only. Originality/value In 2000, the South Korean Government established a special task committee to develop knowledge management systems (KMS) in the public sector and to initiate KM strategies. Since 1997, major South Korean corporations have been developing KM information systems to allow employees to quickly respond to complex and evolving domestic and international market environments. Some of the knowledge management practices effectively implemented in these corporations have been selected as benchmarks for developing the government KMS in the South Korean Government. However, there is limited research on comparative studies of the factors affecting employee KM capabilities in public organizations and private in South Korea. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The application includes an analysis of the transit company's readiness for six sigma, the design and administration of a survey to identify perceptual differences between customers and the organization and the statistical analysis of the survey. The survey analysis is then used to identify differences in perceptions between service employees and customers. These differences provide the basis for the development of a process improvement that employees should be able to undertake. Originality/value - The proposed organizational readiness model is of interest to both researchers and managers. Researchers should find the construct organizational readiness and the proposed components of interest because they provide an area for research related to successful implementation of six sigma programs.

	abstract = {The paper contends that the present global meltdown will end in restructuring and going forward, the restructured global order will certainly be different from the earlier one. Less efficient and outmoded companies will bite the dust, giving way to more efficient organizations with better survival potential. The entire process will involve large scale movements of the workforce, who in consequence, will need to cope up with greater cultural diversity. Managers will be forced to learn to retain their competence when implanted in new cultural environments. Most managers tend to make the mistake of presuming that knowing the language of a particular region or country, is enough. But communication mistakes are not just confined to mastery over the language of another country/region. Many executives also make the mistake of presuming that the social, class, and cultural values underlying management ideas are universally the same. Managers will need to review their earlier paradigms of communication, in order to ensure that lack of effective communication is not a stumbling block in delivering on their targets. The paper gives examples of failure modes of communication in new work environments as also the analysis of those failures. It shows how a comprehensive understanding of the socio-cultural dynamics is vital for retaining the effectiveness in communication. It shows that managers who retain their original cultural identity while adapting to new cultures, are liked and respected for their genuineness. The paper makes it clear that there is a need to understand this phenomenon better by carrying out a structured analysis of the feedback received from managers who were called upon to cope with cultural diversity; in particular the success factors and failure modes observed during dynamics of communication. © Common Ground, Brian Willis.},

Due to the number of involved communities and the complexity of their collaboration, DWH projects are costly. Nevertheless, despite a growing amount of research on DWH project management, success factors of DWH development projects and so forth, we still lack a thorough understanding of how processes on the borders between participating communities, namely boundary spanning and brokering, influence the DWH development process per se. To our knowledge very few studies and with no extensive research have examined this topic. We therefore conducted literature review of a more general research domain, namely information systems development (ISD). As a result, we found helpful implications for the development of DWHs.},

	abstract = {The management of globally distributed software teams is complex because of problems of linguistic differences, geographical dispersion, different time zones, and the cultural diversity of the team members; what is particularly common in software development environments. These problems are amplified when a single software development team is composed of highly skilled individuals working in dispersed geographical locations, and they have to work as a team across distances. This paper describes several of the most importantfactors that contribute to the correct and effective management of global virtual teams for software development and underlying solutions are addressed to reduce cultural and time barriers. These factors are obtained from an industrial case study, which lasted 36 months, corresponding to a huge software development project that involved several global virtual teams. These success factors consider different perspectives as technology, human factors and process. Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Objective: To identify types of clinical unintended adverse consequences resulting from computerized provider order entry (CPOE) implementation. Design: An expert panel provided initial examples of adverse unintended consequences of CPOE. The authors, using qualitative methods, gathered and analyzed additional examples from five successful CPOE sites. Methods: Using a card sort method, the authors developed a categorization scheme for the 79 unintended consequences initially identified and then iteratively modified the scheme to categorize 245 additional adverse consequences resulting from fieldwork. Because the focus centered on consequences requiring prevention or remedial action, the authors did not further analyze reported unintended beneficial (positive) consequences. Results: Unintended adverse consequences (UACs) fell into nine major categories (in order of decreasing frequency): 1) more/new work for clinicians; 2) unfavorable workflow issues; 3) never ending system demands; 4) problems related to paper persistence; 5) untoward changes in communication patterns and practices; 6) negative emotions; 7) generation of new kinds of errors; 8) unexpected changes in the power structure; and 9) overdependence on the technology. Clinical decision support features introduced many of these unintended consequences. Conclusion: Identifying and understanding the types and in some instances the causes of unintended adverse consequences associated with CPOE will enable system developers and implementers to better manage implementation and maintenance of future CPOE projects. © 2006 J Am Med Inform Assoc.},

We also find that the "sophistication" of deployed systems is, in fact, limited - the information held on the systems cannot underpin the strategic goals of the sales/marketing managers. We theorise that adoption of SFA systems is driven by managerial imperatives and that these have resulted in sales force resistance - shown by the paucity of information held on adopted SFA systems. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The paper aims to examine the background to Australian flexible and transnational education and to evaluate the educational and intuitional flexibility of three typical products of the Australian educational software industry. Design/methodology/approach – The history of Australian distance education is summarised and drivers for flexible education are presented. A model of flexible educational software is introduced with three dimensions: educational, institutional and support/training. Three educational software products are informally reviewed using this model to establish that the current generation of Australian educational software offers significant educational and institutional flexibility. Findings – The three examples of Australian educational software rate highly in both educational and institutional flexibility and also offer excellent support. Research limitations/implications – The existence of hot spots of educational technology innovation in relatively isolated areas such as Perth and Tasmania warrants further investigation. Practical implications – The Australian educational software industry produces extremely flexible products with excellent support that are worthy of consideration by international customers. Policy makers in Australia are alerted that current policies in ICT off shoring and the Australian Research Quality Framework (equivalent to the British Research Assessment Exercise) may threaten this industry, which contributes to sizable exports in transnational education.

The introduction of e-commerce has opened a new set of challenges for the IS professionals who are most frequently tasked with developing e-commerce solutions. However, they often do not have the competencies required to successfully execute these e-commerce projects. This competency deficit raises an important question: to what extent have the competency requirements of IS professionals changed because of the introduction of e-commerce? Furthermore, how do IS professionals managed the changes in their work environment due to the implementation of e-commerce in their organisations? Fifteen IS professionals, who are employed in businesses implementing or maintaining e-commerce strategies, were interviewed. The results indicate that the implementation of e-commerce in organisations has introduced three main areas of change to their internal work environment: (a) business changes - the perceptions of senior managers on their current role, (b) project changes - the realization that IS projects have to be managed differently and finally (c) competency changes - the need to acquire new skills and knowledge. As a consequence to these changes, the IS professional developed the following coping skills: (a) reframing - the changing of mental models that determine how we make sense of the world and how we take action based on these models, (b) retooling - the restructuring and reorganising of IS processes, especially around project management and (c) reskilling - the learning of new competencies in the e-commerce environment. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.},

	abstract = {Work is taking over the lives of many employees in today's fast-paced, global environment, and organizations are increasingly offering work–life programs to help employees manage the conflicts and stress resulting from long hours and workload escalation. For some firms, work–life programs are having their intended effect: absenteeism declines, loyalty and retention increase, the ability to recruit talented employees improves, and many employees report that their productivity improves. However, for other firms, work–life programs are not successful, or do not reach their potential for enhancing work–life balance for employees. In some cases employees may not be aware the programs exist, in other cases employees are fearful that their careers will suffer if they participate in the programs. Further, programs sometimes fail because they are not implemented properly, as when employees are not given the necessary technical and management support to work from home. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss potential barriers that may impede the successful implementation and utilization of work–life programs. I will begin by discussing the underlying assumptions and values that influence the way employees and employers think about work and family. For example, I will discuss the ways in which organizations and individuals define success, and how these traditional definitions limit their ability to think creatively about new ways of working. © Cambridge University Press 2008.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper seeks to examine employees' perceptions of TQM practices and its impact on job satisfaction within a large Malaysian outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) organization. Despite extensive research on TQM practices, none examines this scope of investigative study. Therefore, the proposed model was developed with the intention of examining this relationship. Design/methodology/approach - Original research using self-completed questionnaires, distributed to all staff within this organization, is thoroughly reported. The study sample consisted of 230 employees, resulting in a response rate of 76.6 percent. A questionnaire developed by Wright and Cropanzana was used for ascertaining the level of overall job satisfaction. Data were analyzed by employing correlation and multiple regression analysis. Findings - The results revealed that teamwork, organizational trust, organizational culture and customer focus are positively associated with employees' job satisfaction. It is also found that, where teamwork was perceived as a dominant TQM practice, improvements in job satisfaction levels were significant. Further, the result of the multiple regression analysis supports the proposed model based on the empirically validated soft TQM instruments, which are reliable and valid. Originality/value - The findings make a significant contribution by using a major Malaysian OSAT organization that proves to be useful as an example of a methodology that might be used to track the extent of TQM effects on job satisfaction. A firm could use this instrument to do a pre-test baseline measurement, and then periodically re-administer it to identify changes associated with TQM efforts. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach - While 3DCE has been suggested as a way to improve new product development success and supply chain performance, the research on 3DCE is in its infancy, largely conceptual, or based on two, rather than all three aspects of 3DCE. To help bridge the gap between concept and theory for 3DCE, this paper provides a cross-disciplinary perspective, incorporating literature from supply chain management (SCM) and logistics, operations management, marketing channels, and general management and strategy, to help ground the theory of 3DCE. Based on this literature, testable research propositions are developed. Findings - Based on the review of the literature, there is substantial theoretical grounding for 3DCE and evidence that it should provide beneficial outcomes to organizations. 3DCE is also a very useful theoretical lens as researchers become more concerned with taking a systemic view of supply chain and organizational performance. Effectively using 3DCE as a lens may require different research approaches, such as systems dynamics and supply chain mapping. Practical implications - This research provides insights into the relatively low adoption rates of 3DCE in practice. Successful 3DCE requires top management support as well as functional support. It is not simply a SCM tool. Originality/value - From a research perspective, this paper helps provide support for using 3DCE as a theoretical lens for grounding future research. It also provides an insight into research methods that might be most useful in gaining greater understanding of 3DCE practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The research was carried out using an interpretative case study methodology in Singapore. Apart from 26 one-to-one interviews conducted with various stakeholders of the Art Education community, on-site observations were made at 19 different Art Education events. Four major findings emerged. One, the knowledge types of Art Education in Singapore were a blend of different knowledge domains. Two, perceptible knowledge sources were those which conveyed an appearance of authority. Three, knowledge processes in Art Education were steeply humanistic. Finally, factors that affected knowledge processes were (i) the highly competitive Singapore education system, (ii) management support and policies, (iii) personal values and interests, (iv) workload and (v) the absorptive capacity of Art teachers.

This model of trust explicitly includes key concepts that are ignored, but are deemed to be important, in the conceptualization of trust (e.g., confidence and affect). Second, this conceptualization of trust is used in a comprehensive model of customers' trust in e-businesses. This model includes, in a more comprehensive and parsimonious way, key factors that are likely to affect customers' trust in an e-business.

	abstract = {ERP systems are typically the largest, most complex, and most demanding information systems implemented by firms, representing a major departure from the individual and departmental information systems prevalent in the past. Firms and individuals are extensively impacted, and many problematic issues remain to be researched. ERP and related integrated technologies are a transformative force on the accounting profession. As the nature of business evolves, accounting expertise is being called on to make broader contributions such as reporting on nonfinancial measures, auditing information systems, implementing management controls within information systems, and providing management consulting services. This review of ERP research is drawn from an extensive examination of the breadth of ERP-related literature without constraints as to a narrow timeframe or limited journal list, although particular attention is directed to the leading journals in information systems and accounting information systems. Early research consisted of descriptive studies of firms implementing ERP systems. Then researchers started to address other research questions about the factors that lead to successful implementations: the need for change management and expanded forms of user education, whether the financial benefit outweighed the cost, and whether the issues are different depending on organizational type and cultural factors. This research encouraged the development of several major ERP research areas: (1) critical success factors, (2) the organizational impact, and (3) the economic impact of ERP systems. We use this taxonomy to establish (1) what we know, (2) what we need, and (3) where we are going in ERP research. The objective of this review isto synthesize the extant ERP research reported without regard to publication domain and make this readily available to accounting researchers. We organize key ERP research by topics of interest in accounting, and map ERP topics onto existing accounting information systems research areas. An emphasis is placed on topics important to accounting, including (but not limited to): the risk management and auditing of ERP systems, regulatory issues, the internal and external economic impacts of ERP systems, extensions needed in ERP systems for XBRL, for interorganizational support, and for the design of management control systems.},

This investigation will be beneficial for the implementation of IT projects, as well as the comprehension of the organizational and managerial issues related to the discontinuity of IT development in office automation. This paper conducts an interpretative approach by means of qualitative methods - namely through participatory observation and in-depth interviews with fourteen informants - to reveal the managerial issues and their implications on the adoption of electronic government (e-Government). Through the method of content analysis, this study reviews the process of decision making, implementation, and other issues emerging as a result of the adoption of new technologies in public authorities, such as the cognition of the employee toward the benefits and effectiveness of IS in public authorities. Learning from this case, this article identifies key lessons and provides suggestions regarding the managerial issues related to the discontinuity of technologies in the workplace. These goals are achieved through reflexive exploration of the sense-making process among civil servants. In addition, this study shares the experience and suggestions with a government CIO through the proposition of a framework of SPECISM approaches to cope with the challenges from the appropriation of new IT in a public authority. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Based on an analysis of survey data collected from the fastener industry, results show that the industrial environment and network capability are significantly associated with performance in China, but not in Taiwan. The findings highlight the difference between actual and perceived situations which results from what specific context decision makers find themselves in and how they allocate attention to specific issues. In addition, path analysis reveals that both organizational and network capability of Chinese firms are significantly associated with strategy and performance. This demonstrates that the strategy selected by the Chinese firms as a mediator influences their performance. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

For a standardization expert the rationale of a standardization project may be found in the proposal for a new work item or terms of reference, but rarely in the scope statement. However, it is also commonplace that the rationale of the project is not clearly stated in any of these parts. If the rationale is not surfaced in the early phases of a project, it is left to the design, sense-making and negotiation cycles of the design process to orient the project towards a goal. This paper explores how scope statements are used to position standardization projects in the IT for Learning, Education and Training (ITLET) domain, and how scope and rationale are understood in recent projects in European and international standardization.

It seeks to identify the top influencing factors, rank them according to the relative strength of influence, and explore their interactivity. The study uses a documentary review of full business cases of five PFI projects, published reports, and scholarly publications to identify the list of factors; and a questionnaire survey of 44 PFI projects in the UK to establish the ranking of importance. The findings reveal that PFI projects are more strongly affected by client-driven internal factors than external factors. Internal factors, such as design change in the development phase and requests for new works or services in the operational phase were also likely to act independently, while external factors, including conditions for approval, movement in construction costs and change in PFI guidelines, worked interactively. The research findings add to the knowledge of priority factors that need to be addressed to enhance the achievement of long-term VFM in PFI projects. The study is one of the few studies that have investigated VFM of PFI projects from a whole life cycle and dynamic perspective. It reveals not only a list of main influencing factors of project VFM, but also interrelationship between these factors. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the integration of generic software such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) into organisational life. These applications have gained prominence as the IT systems of choice in many organisations. The perspective that dominates the literature studying these applications reflects a rationality based on alignment of the software and organisational processes and fails to consider the ethical issues that arise when a new work system is being constructed, such as the possibilities for end-user participation. Drawing on the strand of research that studies implementations of new technologies as social relations, this paper considers the experiences of end user groups as they engage in adaptation of the software and embed technology in contexts of local use. Design and use activities are complex and multifaceted and the embedding of software for local use represents an overlap between them. This paper explores whether the shift towards large scale generic software allows for a blurring of a boundary between what are construed as design activities and use activities in applications for office work. It is significant to the construction of this boundary that office work is gendered female in the U.K. where clerical and secretarial work is usually done by and considered to be suited to women. The paper draws on a case study of the introduction and integration of a generic software application for supporting the administration of student records at a UK university to explore the social relations of end-user participation in the implementation of these software packages. The paper presents an analysis of the implementation activity, IToffice worker relations, and the different constructions of skills and knowledge understood to be required as the workers attempted to deal with this software application. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose Middle and lowerlevel managers play a significant role in the strategic management process, primarily in the execution stage. However, strategic diffusion – the extent to which a strategy is effectively executed and becomes an integral part of the organization – varies across organizations. This paper aims to examine the strategic diffusion process in two emerging economies, Mexico and Peru. Design/methodology/approach Parnell's strategic diffusion scale (SDS) was adopted for this study. Respondents also completed Cook and Wall's nineitem organizational commitment instrument and a threeitem scale measuring satisfaction with firm performance. Surveys were translated into Spanish and completed by 218 Mexican and 270 Peruvian managers. Findings Strategic diffusion was linked to performance satisfaction among both Mexican and Peruvian managers. Overall, Mexican managers produced higher scores on the strategic diffusion scale (SDS) than did their Peruvian counterparts. The link between strategic diffusion and organizational commitment among middle and lowerlevel managers remains unclear. Research limitations/implications This study supports the strategic diffusion construct and the SDS. Three items in the scale were problematic in certain instances, however. The present study linked strategic diffusion to performance satisfaction in both Mexico and Peru. As expected, Mexican managers exhibited higher SDS scores than did their Peruvian counterparts. The link between strategic diffusion and organizational commitment was not strong, however. Additional research is needed in this area. Practical implications Middle and lower level managers in different countries have different views on the process of strategic diffusion. These distinctions are cause by a number of factors, including stages in the economic development cycle, organizational culture, and widely accepted management practices. Executives seeking to implement strategies should recognize the three key components of strategic diffusion – understanding, involvement, and commitment – and how they are influenced by national contexts. Originality/value There is a dearth of research assessing management behaviors in emerging nations. It is also important to learn more about processes associated with strategy execution in different organizations. This paper addresses both needs by assessing strategic diffusion in Mexico and Peru. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {The notion of outsourcing - making arrangements with an external entity for the provision of goods or services to supplement or replace internal efforts - has been around for centuries. Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2002) track one of the earliest occurrences of outsourcing to the ancient Roman Empire, where tax collection was outsourced. In the early years of American history, the production of wagon covers was outsourced to Scotland, where they used raw material imported from India in the production process (Kelly 2002). Outsourcing remained popular in the manufacturing sector, with part of the assembling in many industries being sub-contracted to other organizations and locations where the work could be done more efficiently and cheaply (Vaze, 2005). Commenting on this unstoppable trend, Pastin and Harrison (1974) wrote that such outsourcing of manufacturing functions was creating a new form of organization which they termed the hollow corporation (i.e., an organization that designs and distributes, but does not produce anything). They note that such an organizational form would require considerable changes in the way organizations were managed. While they limited their research to the role of management in the hollow corporation, they comment on the substantial (and unpleasant) social and economic changes that the outsourcing of manufacturing was causing. It was not long before the idea of outsourcing was applied to the procurement of information technology (IT) services also. While the current wave of IT outsourcing can be traced back to EDS' deal with Blue Cross in the early sixties, it was the landmark Kodak deal in 1989 that won acceptance for IT outsourcing as a strategic tool. Many large and small outsourcing deals were inked in the years that followed. From its beginnings as a cost-cutting tool, IT outsourcing has evolved into an integral component of a firm's overall information systems strategy (Linder, 2004). Still, reducing costs is an idea that never loses its appeal, and the opportunity to meet the IT demands of the organization with a less-expensive but well-trained labor pool has led organizations to look past their national borders, at locations both far and near, for such resources. Recent statistics vouch for the continued acceptance and popularity of IT outsourcing as well as this trend towards outsourcing to different global locations. A Gartner study conducted in 2004 placed global IT outsourcing at $176.8 billion in 2003, and suggested that it would grow to $253.1 billion in 2008 (Souza et al., 2004). A recent IDC Report noted that the IT service market has now reached $746 billion (Fogarty, 2008). While outsourcing has grown beyond the domain of IT embodying decisions such as where and how to source IT to a much wider set of business functions, IT outsourcing still leads the pack with 67% of all global outsourcing deals in 2004 being related to IT (Pruitt, 2004). This inexorable trend towards outsourcing and offshoring brings unique sets of challenges to all parties involved. Western organizations have to walk a tightrope between the savings and efficiencies that offshoring could provide and the adverse reactions from a society increasingly disenchanted by the job displacement and loss that outsourcing brings. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

All firms had to overcome knowledge barriers of two types: those associated with the configuration of the ERP package, and those associated with the assimilation of new work processes. We found that both strong core teams and carefully managed consulting relationships addressed configuration knowledge barriers. User training that included both technical and business processes, along with a phased implementation approach, helped firms to overcome assimilation knowledge barriers. However, all firms in this study experienced ongoing concerns with assimilation knowledge barriers, and we observed two different approaches to address them. In a piecemeal approach, firms concentrated on the technology first and deferred consideration of process changes. In a concerted approach, both the technology and process changes were undertaken together. Although most respondents clearly stated a preference for either piecemeal or concerted change, all firms engaged in practices that reflected a combination of these approaches.},

	abstract = {Catchment management agencies (CMA s) have no tested precedent in South Africa and will have to evolve in complex and changing business, social and natural environments as they strive to ensure that equity and social justice are achieved within ecological limits. Traditionally, very different styles of management have been used for resource exploitation and resource protection and this will present a serious dilemma for CMAs. As the human population has grown and natural resources have declined, there has been increased effort to control nature in order to harvest its products and reduce its threats. Initially such 'command-and-control' management has been successful as agencies prosper on short-term gains. However. when natural variation is reduced the ecosystem loses its resilience and ability to 'bounce back' from disturbances. The first lesson we can learn is that the longer term consequence of command-and-control management is always either a reduction or cessation of resource supply. The second lesson comes from adaptive resource management (ARM). ARM acknowledges that, because nature is in a continual state of flux and our understanding of ecosystem functioning is poor, a fundamental problem for decision makers is that they must deal with uncertainty from an imperfect knowledge base. A learning-by-doing approach becomes a prerequisite for effective management. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to superimpose adaptive management on bureaucratic institutional structures. Such flouting of the fundamental management axiom 'form must follow function', has thwarted many attempts at adaptive management. This provides our third lesson. Recognition that authoritarian, command-and-control, bureaucracies respond too slowly to survive in changing environments has led managers in government, industry and businesses to create 'learning institutions' which combine adaptive operations and generative leadership (lesson four). Effective knowledge management is seen as a critical success factor in turning command-and-control management into adaptive, learn-by-doing management (lesson five). CMAs which recognise the dangers of excessive command and control, the need to integrate stakeholder values and activities. and the potential of an adaptive and generative management approach, will need to structure their activities carefully. At present there is much focus on the structure of CMAs and much less on how they should function. Form is preceding function in many instances: When function is discussed it centres on how regulatory mechanisms and permit systems will keep resource use under control. The concern is seldom with how the ecosystem will be managed. This sort of thinking could lead to a classic command-and-control management approach if not tempered with a more adaptive process. Strategic adaptive management (SAM) is a local derivative of ARM designed to generate consensus management which is inclusive, strategic, adaptive and creative. SAM is a process in which effective knowledge management is central to building a partnership between Science, management and society to achieve a common vision. It has considerable potential for application to CMAs.},

We provide an industry case study of a firm with a normally high IT workload, overloaded in 1998 with three additional large-scale IT projects. Simultaneously, the firm experienced its highest IT staff turnover in recent years. The firm undertook a four-part research study and analysis of its problems. A balanced program was implemented based on the results of the study, focusing on interesting and challenging work, working environment and compensation. IT retention increased dramatically from a low of 76% in September 1998 to 84% in late 1998 to 98% in most of 1999. Key business imperatives are proceeding on schedule, new work is being managed, and IT's contribution has become a recognized success factor for the company as a whole.},

Empirical results from a study of 160 new initiatives in 40 organizations from 16 countries suggest that: (1) it is feasible to operationalize and measure these constructs; (2) comprehension and deftness are important correlates of an organization's degree of competence as defined; and (3) a process‐centered paradigm for understanding competence development shows promise.

Systems development and implementation offer an opportunity for higher-order organizational learning that is rarely exploited. Advanced information systems, in particular expert systems (ES) and executive information systems (EIS), provide ample opportunities for higher-order organizational learning if the development process is structured in certain ways. This work includes an analysis of three organizations in terms of project outcomes, organizational learning outcomes, and organizational performance. On the basis of these assessments, five critical success factors are identified that may contribute to organizational learning during advanced system development. The relationships between these factors and organizational outcomes are summarized in a preliminary model that can form the basis for future research. The work closes with some recommendations for ways information systems managers can encourage higher-order organizational learning during advanced system development.},

	abstract = {The way in which clients or their consultants undertake to select firms to tender for a given project is a highly complex process and can be very problematic. This is also true for public authorities as, for them, ‘compulsory competitive tendering’ is a relatively new concept. Despite its importance, contractors' prequalification is often based on heuristic techniques combining experience, judgement and intuition of the decision makers. This, primarily, stems from the fact that prequalification is not an exact science. For any project, the right choice of the contractor is one of the most important decisions that the client has to make. Therefore, it is envisaged that the development of an effective decision-support model for contractor prequalification can yield significant benefits to the client. By implication, such a model can also be of considerable use to contractors: a model of this nature is an effective marketing tool for contractors to enhance their chances of success to obtain new work. To this end, this work offers a decision-support model that predicts whether or not a contractor should be selected for tendering projects. The focus is on local authorities because, in the absence of a viable universal selection system, there are significant variations in the way they conduct prequalification. The model is based on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and uses data relating to 42 local authorities (clients). With the aid of a questionnaire and a scaling system, the prequalification attributes that are considered to be important by clients are identified. The survey indicates significant variations in the level of importance given to different attributes. Statistical methods are adopted to generate additional data representing disqualified instances. Following a preprocessing exercise, the data form the basis of the input and output layers for training the neural-net model. An independent set of data is subjected to a similar preprocessing for testing the model. Tests reveal that the model has a highly satisfactory predictive accuracy and that the ANN technique is a viable tool for the prediction of success or failure of the contractor to qualify to tender for local authority projects. © 1999, MCB UP Limited},

The organisation's need to distinguish among these components of an EKO is argued by comparing and contrasting the different conceptual bases, objectives, processes, systems, performance measures and culture of each module. This viewpoint integrates many concepts and applications from various literatures, but it is somewhat contrary to the conventional wisdom which has tended to de-emphasise the significance of communications and information technology in knowledge management.

Then, we identify the fundamental competencies of leaders in a quality organization. Supported by an extensive literature review, we propose a structural equation model for leadership. To illustrate its application, we present a simplified example. Given the criticality of leadership, the emergence of a model that expands the understanding of the leadership construct and its measurement is of major importance for organizations to pursue business excellence.

Most higher education institutions are directly trying to address the training needs of SMEs, spurred on by various Government initiatives. Much of the available funding is targeted at the introduction and development of new technologies in SMEs. The information systems education and training requirements of SMEs are reviewed and examined against the changing face of Higher Education. A series of studies was undertaken to examine the information systems learning needs of a small number of diverse SMEs. The results of these studies are discussed and compared with the outcomes of previous research into learning in SMEs and similarities and dissonances highlighted. The paper concludes with a discussion as to whether higher education can meet some of the information systems learning needs of SMEs. © 1999, MCB UP Limited},

Entrepreneurial action is fundamentally characterised by the issue as to how the efficiency of an enterprises organisational structure and thus the enterprises market position can be improved. In many cases, IT solutions are implemented for the purpose of increasing performance. However, the possibility that these might not always fulfil expectations cannot be ruled out. Subject to certain preconditions, organisational measures which go beyond traditional hierarchies can prove considerably more effective. Such measures can only prove successful in the long term if, besides changes in the organisational structure, changes are also made in the organisational culture and in particular in the management culture.},

Therefore, leadership is the prime aspect of Kanji's Business Excellence Model (KBEM) (Kanji, 1998). Given the criticality of leadership, a new model for measuring leadership excellence was developed (Kanji & Sá, 2001), based on an extensive literature review. This model, which expands the concept of leadership embedded in KBEM, was empirically tested and validated in the Portuguese municipalities. A brief analysis of key leadership responsibilities in implementing TQM initiatives (Dale et al., 1997; Darling, 1999; Derlng, 1998; Prabhu & Robson, 2000a, 2000b; Senge, 1990; Zairi, 1999) points to the need to develop new leadership profiles in the public sector (Hartley & Allison, 2000; Korac-Kakabadse & Korac-Kakabadse, 1998; Morgan & Murgatroyd, 1994; Rago, 1996; Skelcher, 1992) and in the local government in particular (Gabris et al., 2000; Gaster, 1996; Jones, 1999; West et al., 1993). The leadership model developed incorporates the critical success factors thus identified. Based on these constructs, measurement scales were created and the resulting questionnaire administered to the Portuguese municipalities. Eighty-five municipalities participated in the study. The paper reports the main results of this application, which broadly confirm the structure of proposed model and demonstrate that the leadership roles and competencies identified have, in fact, a positive impact on leadership excellence. From the findings, possible improvement strategies are discussed.},

The research in TQM has emerged from practical needs of organizations embracing this philosophy, and the literature is mostly conceptual and practitioner‐oriented. There is a lack of sound theoretical framework classifying past efforts and guiding future research. To fill the void, a study of the published TQM literature is undertaken. A review, classification, and analysis of the research in TQM spanning the last two decades is presented. A total of 226 TQM‐related articles are identified from 44 refereed management journals published from 1970 to 1993. These articles are then classified and analyzed using the following two‐dimensional scheme: (1) article orientation (conceptual, case study, empirical, analytical, simulation, and overview) and (2) article focus using the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria. The analysis of the literature presents pertinent developments in each of the seven criteria. In addition, it provides future research directions as well as a ready reference of the TQM literature. The suggestions for research should guide future developments in the TQM field and help transform it into a formal discipline. © 1995 Production and Operations Management Society},

Through the answers to the research questions, I wish to demonstrate the paths to deutero-learning, which seldom can be empirically identified in an organization. The paper uses notions of strategic, operational and cultural outcomes—including their intangible and tangible manifestations—to explain different results in organizational learning processes. From 1998 to 1999, the pharmaceutical case company applied an evolutionary, process simulation-based business process development method. This method was used to invent and implement business process innovations in the New Product Development process, to shorten the time-to-market of its new medical entities. Successive process simulations guided and focused the business process development and actions on the strategically most valuable areas. The process simulations prepared the organization for the change, and promoted the implementation of the process outcomes. The successive simulations have triggered and thereafter sustained individual and organizational learning. Thus, they have accelerated organizational learning processes and the development of knowledge and innovations. The case demonstrates efficient deutero-learning, enabled through empowered successive process simulations. The results indicate that development projects are more successful, if there are intangible learning outcomes and systemic process learning at the early stages of the project. This also supports double-loop learning in the business process development project and assists changes in norms to occur. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Questions assessed part-time work and its effect on professional and family issues. The effects of education, radiology practice characteristics, organizational support, human resource practices, and family responsibilities on career and professional satisfaction were studied. RESULTS: Ten and a half percent of the radiologists surveyed - 7.4% of the men and 30.2% of the women - were working part-time. The part-time radiologists reported earning 56.3% of the income earned by full-time radiologists and working 56.9% of the hours worked by their full-time counterparts, with disproportionately fewer benefits. Part-time private practice radiologists were significantly less likely to be partners. For academic radiologists, having worked part-time at any time was significantly associated with lower academic rank. CONCLUSION: The motivation for working part-time differed significantly according to gender and age. Benefits were disproportionate, and radiologists who had worked part-time were less likely to be partners or full professors.},

This was found to be further exacerbated by the absence of a quality focus during the design process, which resulted in the supply-chain becoming dysfunctional inasmuch as rework emerged downstream in the production process.

A content analysis of these responses uncovered critical information for understanding what employees are looking for in a BBS program. A perception survey administered to individual employees (n = 701) at these organizations measured a variety of variables identified in prior research to influence success in safety efforts. The survey data showed five variables to be significantly predictive of employee involvement in a BBS process: 1) perceptions that BBS training was effective; 2) trust in management abilities; 3) accountability for BBS through performance appraisals; 4) whether or not one had received education in BBS; and 5) tenure with the organization. Also, employees in organizations mandating employee participation in a BBS process (n=8 companies) reported significantly higher levels of: (a) involvement; (b) trust in management; (c) trust in coworkers; and (d) satisfaction with BBS training than did employees whose process was completely voluntary (n = 12 companies). In addition, employees in mandatory processes reported significantly greater frequency of giving and receiving positive behavior-based feedback. © 1999 National Safety Council and Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fundamental differences are identified between the nature and functioning of family-owned and -managed businesses and those that are not family-controlled. These differences include the time horizons of management, the implications of business failure, the degree of job security, the centralization of decision-making, accountability for decision-making, and the impact of the family system on the business system, among others. It is argued that the most significant of these differences concerns the way in which executive succession occurs, and specifically, unique aspects of the process of intergenerational transfer within family-owned businesses. Based on an initial round of interviews with second-and third-generation family business owners, and a detailed review of the extant literature, a model is proposed consisting of three sets of determinants of successful family business transitions: the preparation level of the heirs, the nature of relationships among family members, and the types of planning and control activities engaged in by the management of the family business. Successful transitions are further hypothesized to influence subsequent company performance. Much of the research to date on family business transitions has tended to be qualitative, case-oriented, and/or anecdotal in nature. The result has been a number of rich insights into the complexities and dynamics of the family enterprise, but limited in terms of the generalizability of the findings. Considerably less attention has been devoted to quantitative studies that employ larger samples and provide empirical tests of relationships between key variables. This lack of attention is traced to inherent measurement difficulties in the family business field, and to the relatively young status of the field itself as a distinct area receiving academic attention. The current study attempts to bridge this gap. The study provides a quantitative assessment of the proposed model using two cross-sectional sub-samples consisting of 209 second-and third-generation family-owned businesses. Both regression and structural equations (LISREL) analyses are employed. The results indicate support for the proposed model. Family business transitions do occur more smoothly when heirs are better prepared, when relationships among family members are more trust-based and affable, and when family businesses engage in more planning for taxation and wealth-transfer purposes. Of these factors, relationships within the family has the single greatest impact on successful transitions. At the same time, smoother transitions do not necessarily result in better post-transition performance by the enterprise. This linkage to performance appears to be more complex. One possibility is that some level of conflict or strife is a prerequisite for the transition to have a significant impact on subsequent performance. Based on these results, family business owners are encouraged to devote relatively more attention to relationship issues, and relatively less to estate and tax planning. It is suggested that a "relationship charter" be developed as a vehicle for strategically managing relationships within the family, much as relationships must be managed with suppliers or customers. Suggestions are also made for further research, and the study's limitations are denoted. Researchers are encouraged to devote efforts to exploring relationships among the exogenous variables in the research model, such as that between preparation levels of heirs and family relationships. Further, the issue of success and failure in second-and third-generation businesses warrants greater attention, including identification of key failure and success factors as well as determination of differences in failure rates for family-versus non-family-owned businesses and isolation of the reasons for such differences. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Recent developments have included increased organisational and academic interest in the six sigma approach to business improvement. There are many organisational examples (mainly USA and UK based) of large scale improvements in defect and process measures attributed to this approach However, there is a paucity of critical studies on six sigma beyond that of "how to" and that of descriptive accounts, with a focus on measures and results rather than employee involvement and motivation. The aim of this paper is to explore the development of six sigma in a multilevel case analysis, from both a process perspective and a people perspective. The findings show that the case organisation had to widen its conception and application of six sigma to include people and organisational criteria to enable the approach to become embedded in the organisation.},

Increased entropy may cause fragmentation of existing industries in a sector, while systemic adaptation may lead to concentration of industries in one sector. The industrial organization perspective leads one to assume that because firms in an industry share a common technology or production function, their responses to external stimuli and likely outcomes are unlikely to differ qualitatively. However, from the resource-based view, one may make out a case for inter-firm differences in resources and capabilities, imprinting consistent patterns of outcome of increase in the market share of industry leaders. Exploring the transformation witnessed by the manufacturing industry in India, following the changes ushered in by the Exim policy (1997–2002), this article identifies distinct patterns that industry leaders have set for themselves. Capability, guerilla and complexity logic again posit different outcomes of firms' efforts to sustain competitive advantages related to different assumptions of market conditions.

The interpretative processes through which managers enact with environmental and organisational context are crucial for how they act in the change management process. And even if, according to the literature, the interaction between managerial cognitions and managerial actions is most explicit through individual learning, in this paper, we propose an integrated framework baptised the CULTURE Model as the main mediator for explaining the interactions between these two concepts. The CULTURE Model, which is an acronym of Community, Understanding, Language, Trust, Unification, Reflection and Emotions, is built upon the theory of Communities of Practice and advances our understanding of the sharing of managers' knowledge structure in three principal ways. First, it acts as an enabling and motivating mechanism for sharing knowledge structures. Second, it provides a useful illustration for comprehending the interplay between cognition and action. Third, it helps managers to make sound decisions during the progress of change processes. In such processes, actors inevitably participate and share their knowledge structures, experience and practices that may help to define appropriate actions and move forward in the change process. We discuss how the interaction between managerial cognitions and managerial actions within Communities of Practices affects the effectiveness of the change process.

	abstract = {This thesis endeavors to answer to two specific questions. Is it possible to formulate a theory of production? Does such a theory add to our understanding and lead to improved performance when applied to construction? The answer to the first question is sought by reviewing the history of production thinking both from the scientific and the industrial points of view. Historical analysis reveals that three different conceptualizations of production have been used in practice and conceptually advanced in the 20th century. In the first conceptualization, production is viewed as a transformation of inputs to outputs. Production management equates to decomposing the total transformation into elementary transformations, tasks, and carrying out the tasks as efficiently as possible. The second conceptualization views production as a flow, where, in addition to transformation, there are waiting, inspection and moving stages. Production management equates to minimizing the share of non-transformation stages of the production flow, especially by reducing variability. The third conceptualization views production as a means for the fulfillment of the customer needs. Production management equates to translating these needs accurately into a design solution and then producing products that conform to the specified design. It is argued that all these conceptualizations are necessary, and they should be utilized simultaneously. The resulting transformation-flow-value generation model of production is called the TFV theory of production. It is noteworthy that this same new conceptualization also applies to product design and development, as revealed by a historical analysis of this field. But does this explicit theory help us with regard to construction? In various countries, construction has long since suffered from productivity and quality problems. A case study and the results of prior research on contemporary construction show that there are endemic management problems associated with both client decision-making, design management and construction management. An interpretation based on the TFV theory reveals that a significant part of these problems are self-inflicted, caused by the prevailing, limited view on production. Thus, the TFV theory largely explains the origins of construction problems. When initial implementation by pioneering companies of the construction industry is studied it is also clear that methods based on the TFV theory bring manifest benefits. Thus, the TFV theory of production should be applied to construction. The theory explains the problems in contemporary construction, and suggests vastly improved efficiency. The answer to the research questions can thus be summarized shortly. It is possible to formulate a theory of production, which also provides a new theoretical foundation for construction. The resultant TFV theory, even in its emergent state, already provides direction for experimentation and creation of new understanding and capabilities, both regarding construction research and practice.},

However, it lacks scientifically developed and tested constructs that represent an integrative QM philosophy. Moreover, an impact of the prescribed QM strategies on a firm's product quality has not been analyzed. Through a detailed analysis of the literature, this research identifies 12 constructs of integrated QM strategies. Using a survey of 371 manufacturing firms, the constructs are then empirically tested and validated. LISREL 7 is used for this purpose. Finally, a framework to examine the effects of integrated QM strategies on a firm's product quality is suggested. Comparisons between this and two other comprehensive scales of TQM are made.},

Anticipatory activities prepare the firm for future strategic surprises and enhance the firm's effectiveness in dealing with turbulence and unpredictability in the external environment. Hindsight activities on the other hand, rely greatly on ex-post analysis (of information on past events), emphasize efficiency in key processes and operations, and are predicted on reasonable continuity and stability in the external environment. While both sets of activities are necessary to maintain the balance between effectiveness and efficiency, a relatively greater emphasis on one set or the other is crucial under different degrees of environmental turbulence and unpredictability. Informed implementation of the appropriate degrees of anticipatory and hindsight orientations through differentially emphasizing separate sets of strategic planning activities should enable managers to exercise better strategic control and optimize the firm's short-run performance as well as long-term prospects. © 1992.},

	abstract = {Strategic management has been an important topic in library and information services (LIS) since the 1980s. In the 1990s, quality management has played a similar role. This paper examines the relationship between these two management concepts in a LIS sector setting. After the presentation of different conceptual frameworks, a new strategic quality management (SQM) framework - inspired by the Japanese hoshin kanri or policy deployment approach - is developed, emphasising that strategic management and total quality management (TQM) should be treated as one integrated management process. Then TQM-based and strategic management methodologies are compared in order to identify common traits and differences. Finally, it is discussed how the theoretical considerations made may influence the validity of practical managerial advice found in the library management literature. Based on the conceptual framework of this article, empirical data from the 1995 Nordic SQM survey of business information services (corporate information centres, special libraries and academic libraries) are presented in the next issue of the Journal of Information Science.},

	abstract = {The field of knowledge management continues to garner both academic and practitioner interest. While much has been written about the technological, social, and economic aspects of managing knowledge in organizations, little is known about the managers who lead the engagements. In the following research project, we examine the roles of three C-level executives - Chief Knowledge Officers, Chief Learning Officers, and Chief Privacy Officers, these individuals are tasked (and titled) to manage various aspects of an organization's knowledge assets. Specifically, we seek to explicate how the three kinds of Chiefs contribute to knowledge management activities of the organization. To this end, we have employed a two-stage research methodology. First, we searched for news announcements reflecting newly created CKO, CLO, and CPO positions. A thorough coding of these announcements was conducted to profile CKOs, CLOs, and CPOs. Moreover, we examined the reasons for their hiring and their expected contribution to the organization. In the second stage of the research, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a select group of CKOs, CLOs, and CPOs to gather further insights and to validate findings from the secondary data. We have discovered that the three Chiefs play distinct yet inter-related roles in knowledge management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
