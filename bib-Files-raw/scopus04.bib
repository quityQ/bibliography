	abstract = {This article reviews the individual and organizational implications of gig work using the emerging psychological contract between gig workers and employing organizations as a lens. We first examine extant definitions of gig work and provide a conceptually clear definition. We then outline why both organizations and individuals may prefer gig work, offer an in-depth analysis of the ways in which the traditional psychological contract has been altered for both organizations and gig workers, and detail the impact of that new contract on gig workers. Specifically, organizations deconstruct jobs into standardized tasks and gig workers adapt by engaging in job crafting and work identity management. Second, organizational recruitment of gig workers alters the level and type of commitment gig workers feel toward an employing organization. Third, organizations use a variety of nontraditional practices to manage gig workers (e.g., including by digital algorithms) and gig workers adapt by balancing autonomy and dependence. Fourth, compensation tends to be project-based and typically lacks benefits, causing gig workers to learn to be a “jack-of-all-trades” and learn to deal with pay volatility. Fifth, organizational training of gig workers is limited, and they adapt by engaging in self-development. Sixth, gig workers develop alternative professional and social relationships to work in blended teams assembled by organizations and/or adapt to social isolation. Challenges associated with these practices and possible solutions are discussed, and we develop propositions for testing in future research. Finally, we highlight specific areas for further exploration in future research. © 2022 American Psychological Association},

	abstract = {The practice and popularity of telework has expanded significantly in the past few years, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a critical factor contributing to business resilience, the new work model challenged companies to figure out innovative ways to address contemporary organizational and employee needs. To address this gap, this study approaches the telework concept from a broader perspective, integrating inputs, outputs and outcomes in an analytical framework. Drawing from data collected based on interviews and questionnaires addressed to professionals in the business service industry who experienced telework, frequency analysis, discourse analysis and chi-square test were used to synthesize the findings. Results show that resource availability and professional relationships represent the basic factors, while technology may be more than a facilitator. Moreover, knowledge exchange, work–life balance and professional isolation are critical factors emerging from the virtual environment that influence work goals achievement. This study contributes to research by proposing a Telework Systematic Model (TSM), which addresses the interaction of various organizational dynamics factors as a result of mixed working patterns. The discussions address the future of work by including the hybrid work model, platform innovation and new business opportunities to enhance organizational resilience for sustainable innovation and change through digital technology. © 2022 by the authors.

In so doing there is better understanding of what motives or values persons bring to their professional practice, particularly too, if those missions and values emanate from a colonial hegemony still in existence within a postcolonial society. Persons could be causing harm or doing what is beneficial. They need to know what they are perpetuating and why. This book is primarily for those with interests in domination, power, capitalism, colonialism and neocolonialism; those planning professional development courses for teachers, principals and administrators in the field of education and other areas of professional practice; life history researchers; auto-ethnographers; postgraduate students and qualitative researchers in higher education, specifically and education, generally. © 2022 Peter Lang Publishing, Inc.

	abstract = {The changes that are constantly occurring in the labour sector have led organisations and companies to move towards digital transformation. This process was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and conducted to a massive recourse to the practice of remote working, which in this study is understood as the term for the way of performing work outside the usual workplace and with the support of ICT. Currently, there are no flexible scales in the literature that allow measuring the benefits and disadvantages of remote working with a single instrument. Thus, the distinction between the positive and negative consequences of working remotely, substantiated by a solid literature, provides a framework for a systematical understanding of the issue. The aim of the present study is to develop and validate a scale on remote working benefits and disadvantages (RW-B&D scale). For this end, a preliminary Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with 304 participants, a tailored EFA with a sample of 301 workers and a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 677 workers were conducted. Participants were all Italian employees who worked remotely during the period of the COVID-19 health emergency. Data were collected between October 2020 and April 2021. The psychometric robustness of the model was assessed through bootstrap validation (5000 resamples), fit indices testing and measurement of factorial invariance. The statistical analyses demonstrated the bifactorial nature of the scale, supporting the research hypothesis. The model showed good fit indices, bootstrap validation reported statistically significant saturations, good reliability indices, and convergent and discriminant validity. Measurement invariance was tested for gender and organisational sector. The results suggested that the novel scale facilitates the quantitative measurement of the benefits and disadvantages associated with remote working in empirical terms. For this reason, it could be a streamlined and psychometrically valid instrument to identify the potential difficulties arising from remote working and, at the same time, the positive aspects that can be implemented to improve organisational well-being. © 2022, The Author(s).},

We obtain several results. First, we find a significantly enhanced capability of firms that adopted WFH during the pandemic to sustain the overall organizational performance, particularly when such a work practice is used intensively. Less deteriorated labor productivity and workers’ concentration and motivation, decreased absenteeism, and a substantial rise in the adoption of MBO practices seem to be important aspects behind the detected benefits related to WFH. Third, when WFH is used at medium levels of intensity, it is associated with augmented coordination and communication costs, which nonetheless do not appear to overcome the benefits associated with WFH. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Responding to global competition and pressure from financial markets, companies are asking employees to do more with less, even as new technologies normalize 24/7 job expectations. In Overload, Erin Kelly and Phyllis Moen document how this new intensification of work creates chronic stress, leading to burnout, attrition, and underperformance. “Flexible” work policies and corporate lip service about “work-life balance” don’t come close to fixing the problem. But this unhealthy and unsustainable situation can be changed-and Overload shows how. Drawing on five years of research, including hundreds of interviews with employees and managers, Kelly and Moen tell the story of a major experiment that they helped design and implement at a Fortune 500 firm. The company adopted creative and practical work redesigns that gave workers more control over how and where they worked and encouraged managers to evaluate performance in new ways. The result? Employees’ health, well-being, and ability to manage their personal and work lives improved, while the company benefited from higher job satisfaction and lower turnover. And, as Kelly and Moen show, such changes can-and should-be made on a wide scale. Complete with advice about ways that employees, managers, and corporate leaders can begin to question and fix one of today’s most serious workplace problems, Overload is an inspiring account about how rethinking and redesigning work could transform our lives and companies. © 2020 by Prince ton University Press.},

This article’s purpose is to introduce and understand ‘whose body counts’ – a discourse of bodily exceptionalism in performative organisational cultures. Using ethnographic methods, this article presents an analysis of a CrossFit workplace health promotion at an underperforming US corporation, to identify a complex process of empowerment, self-exploitation and disciplinary regulation to produce performative outcomes. This research illustrates how the workplace health promotion generates a pervasive discourse of exceptionalism underpinned by workers’ reflexive exploitation, overarched by peer-surveillance and reflexively embraced through extreme individualised performativities. Critically, it is revealed how individuals competitively engage in communicative labour to demonstrate devotion to self-care that is translated into organisational commitment. Specifically, unquestioned discursive ambiguities are shown to cunningly empower limitlessness meritocratic striving that pits workers against each other, creating constant negotiation of ‘whose body counts’ by subjugating others. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Although previous studies have found that long working hours can cause physical and mental health problems in employees, the nature of the relationship between working hours and job satisfaction remains little understood. We have theorised that there is a curvilinear association between working hours and job satisfaction, and tested this hypothesis. A total of 771 adult Chinese employees submitted self-reported measures of working hours, job satisfaction, and job autonomy. The results show that working hours have an inverted U-shaped association with job satisfaction. Work scheduling autonomy and decision-making autonomy moderate this relationship.

The discussion about the changed work design is diverse and often revolves around the topics of trust and control. Affected are changing leadership concepts, effects on teamwork, engagement of the employees, and organizational culture, as well as issues such as greater participation and inclusion of diverse workers and new human resource policies. The authors will explore the question of how remote work policies must be designed to do justice to the principles of personnel and organizational policy. Based on our study, they demonstrate that remote work brings many advantages to the organization on an individual, team, and organizational level. However, they identified the "dark side" of remote work, especially for women with care responsibilities, as a negative impact on their professional activities. © 2024, IGI Global.

This may involve predictive care, but also clients who organize themselves via, for example, a platform in order to gain more influence on the care process. This is about the connection between technological innovation and social innovation. Technological innovation has various components: Home, Garden and Kitchen Technology, but also the application possibilities of artificial intelligence. Social innovation is reflected in, for example, healthcare cooperatives. Social innovation is expressed in various ways to achieve more autonomy. An important part is that clients have access to their own health information. In terms of policy, it is about interpreting demand-driven management: the organization of care on the basis of an equal position between client and care professional, whereby the client has the relevant health information available. Interacting with each other in a certain way creates a form of life however, it can also be interpreted differently. For both, it is about finding meaning in which the unequal roles lead to equal people. Important elements are: understanding of each other's position, reflection on the own position, provision of information that matches the client's wishes and approach of the care professional, information provision that meets the needs of informal caregivers, funding model that facilitates equivalence and space for professionals to handle variety (innovation of regulatory space). © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The rapid growth of digital economic activity had led to considerable scholarly interest in the phenomenon of platforms. Evidence shows how digital work platforms constitute one of the most relevant changes that have occurred in recent years and assume the condition of actors with an important presence in national and global work markets. However, these changes cannot be understood by focusing only on the work sphere, as the sphere of consumption is also central to this debate. In fact, the new ways of organizing, dividing and coordinating work on digital platforms are interconnected with specific modalities of consumption of the services made available by them. This article argues that a service relation approach allows an understanding of what is happening on digital work platforms, both in terms of the structural and conjunctural configurations of the interrelationships between platforms, workers and clients, as well as their social and economic consequences. This approach allows the analysis of the web of interdependencies between distinctive types of platforms, workers and clients, and to discuss how changes longitudinally within it are conditioned by the very transformations inherent to the platforms market. Thus, future research needs to explore the network of the voices of platforms, workers and clients in order to produce a robust analysis of these triangular relations as well as of the challenges regarding the differences and interconnections between algorithmic and human management.

This study draws on job demands-resources theory (JD-R) to understand the role of job-related training and resources on perceived work unit performance and turnover intention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), I find that workers who reported needing, but not receiving, training or resources to cope with new work roles were more likely to report a deterioration in their work unit’s performance and to report new intentions to leave their job. These effects were stronger when an employee’s demands increased over the pandemic. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing demands and resources as organizational leaders react to turbulent conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Platform-based work and corresponding business models are redefining the work landscape. The rapid growth in digital platforms has prospered since the start of the pandemic, enabling various service-based gig work tasks such as Amazon, Uber and Deliveroo. Currently, there is scant literature that examines the well-being of gig workers in the platform economy. In this article, we reflect on the well-being of one category of gig workers, low-skilled service-based gig workers. These workers are often migrants or transient workers who face barriers to enter the job market in a foreign country, need a job to generate an income for the family, often transition between jobs or wish to conduct flexible, temporary gigs afforded by many digital platforms. Informed by an overview of the literature and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) definition of well-being, our study supports the notion that precarity leads to compromised worker well-being. As a consequence, we iden-tify four themes for gig worker well-being that can be incorporated in the design of platforms to improve the well-being of low-skilled service-based workers: (1) regulatory aspects and contracts to protect the worker, (2) job-related appraisal and reward systems, (3) feeling connected in a work-related social network and (4) algorithmic control and organization of tasks and work. Our study opens discourse on digital platform worker well-being, suggesting improvements to digital platform design to support worker well-being for service-based gig workers and potentially all forms of gig work. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

Data were collected from 277 company employees in Bahrain through online questionnaires and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The purpose of the study is to examine the relationships between psychological well-being, job satisfaction, trust in supervisor, and job performance through the use of a theoretical framework that synthesizes prominent models in the field of organizational psychology. The research findings indicate a positive influence of psychological well-being on both job satisfaction and job performance. Notably, job satisfaction plays a mediating role in the relationship between psychological well-being and job performance. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering an integrated approach to examining the intricate connections between psychological well-being, job satisfaction, trust in supervisor, and job performance, which all are crucial for creating a sustainable workplace environment and outcomes. Practical implications highlight the need for organizations to prioritize employee psychological well-being through initiatives such as wellness programs and supportive work environments, as these initiatives directly influence job satisfaction and performance. Job satisfaction acts as a significant mediator, emphasizing the importance of fair compensation, recognition, and professional development in enhancing job satisfaction. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust millions of workers into high-intensity telecommuting. While much research has examined the first months of the pandemic, little is known about how workers have responded to this new work arrangement over time. The stressor-reaction perspective suggests that any strain related to the physical separation from coworkers may persist as long as the stressor is present, while the adaptation perspective implies that individuals adopt new behaviours that help them adjust once the initial shock is over. This research examines the changes in work belongingness, meaningful work, and emotional exhaustion following a shift to high-intensity telecommuting, between September 2020 and March 2021. We conducted a four-wave study among an organizational sample of 716 workers who transitioned to high-intensity telecommuting during the pandemic. Latent growth modelling analyses showed that new high-intensity telecommuters experienced declines in work belongingness over time, which in turn led to decreased perceptions that their work was meaningful and increased emotional exhaustion, supporting the stress-reaction perspective. Contrary to theoretical predictions, trajectories were worse for those with a higher initial affective commitment to coworkers. We discuss how our findings can inform scholars and practitioners about the unfolding consequences of a collective shift to high-intensity telecommuting. © 2024 The Authors.

Academics are the pillars of higher education institutions’ (HEIs) mission to provide quality education to students and the community, supporting socioeconomic development. Most academics today are overworked and overburdened with duties, forcing them to work longer hours on weekends and at odd hours. This eventually affects their work–life balance and causes boundary conflicts between work and personal life. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a bibliometric analysis to investigate the underlying knowledge structure of this phenomenon by uncovering the past and present themes and predicting future trends of WLB in academia. This review adopts two analyses (bibliographic coupling and co-word analysis), presenting the knowledge structure network. A total of 307 journal publications were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, revealing significant clusters and themes. Findings: Findings identified central themes, including the issue of women in academia, predictors and the impact of WLB in academia. Research limitations/implications: Implications towards research and practice relevant to scholars and practitioners are discussed, particularly in balancing academics, professional work and personal life.

The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine to what extent Covid-19 WFH changed trust relationships among remote employees, their managers and organisations and how this has taken place. Design/methodology/approach: The study used semi-structured interviews with employees and managers from different organisations across different sectors. Interviews were supported with image prompts as suggested by the storyboarding method, and took place between November 2020 and February 2021. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings: The findings identified factors that contribute to trust disruption and factors that led to trust preservation within the changing workspace landscape enforced by WFH environment. Employees reported trust in their organisations, feeling as though their organisations proven resilient at the time of the crisis caused by the pandemic. Interestingly, managers reported trust in employees to remain productive but also anxieties due to the possible presence of others in the household. Originality/value: The study identified factors that affect intra-organisational trust that have not been previously recognised, exposing tensions and challenges that may disrupt trust relations between managers and employees whilst also identifying evidence of trust preservation in the Covid-19 WFH context. The study has implications for workplace learning within the remote, WFH context, which are discussed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: In view of the advancing digitalization of the German banking sector, offering remote work can be an opportunity for banks to meet changing customer and employee needs at the same time. It allows flexible consultations at changing locations and, due to the high degree of autonomy, it also increases motivation, meaningfulness, happiness at work, and commitment. (2) Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental design to investigate how remote work affects happiness at work and affective commitment among employees in a German public bank. Therefore, two groups of customer advisors were examined, who work either remotely (N = 32) or stationary (N = 110) at similar tasks. (3) Results: The group comparisons show significantly higher values overall on three of the investigated four happiness dimensions (“meaningfulness”, “self-actualization”, and “community professional”) for employees in the remote group. Commitment also differs, as employees in the remote group show significantly stronger commitment. The quantitative results were confirmed by qualitative interviews. (4) Conclusions: By investigating the positive effects of remote working, this study shows new findings on what is likely to be a growing design form of New Work in the future. The study provides evidence that self-selected work environments and working hours offer an opportunity to make work more conducive to happiness—even in a sector that still undergoes significant shifts. © 2022 by the authors.},

Neoliberalism constitutes a form of governmentality which encourages people to regard themselves as autonomous and to aspire to personal fulfillment by investing entrepreneurially in themselves as “human capital.” Healthism, which requires individuals be responsible for their own health and wellbeing, is one program by which this is accomplished. We analyze managers’ talk about themselves as people who self-examined, and sought continually to transform (improve) themselves, to avow identities as superior (heroic) leaders. Our study contributes to the literature on governmentality by showing how in neoliberalism “healthism” constructs managers as enterprising selves. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the impact of work autonomy and work-life balance on job satisfaction in teleworking. The non-probabilistic sampling technique was used for convenience, cross-sectional of causal relationship through the structural equation model (SEM). The study population was made up of people residing in Lima who reported having been working in the teleworking modality. The sample consisted of 326 teleworkers (65.3% women and 34.7% men). The results showed that both work autonomy and work-life balance have a direct, positive, and significant impact on job satisfaction; being the work-life balance the one that presented a greater impact on job satisfaction (R=0.679, p<0.000). Likewise, labor autonomy presented a minor impact (R= 0.405, p<0.000), but equally important. The global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic conditioned organizations to adopt the teleworking modality on a mandatory basis in several of their operations , registering an increase in the emotional exhaustion and work burnout that impacted the quality of life , mental health and job satisfaction of workers due to the effort in adapting to the job and the context they faced [1], [2] Among the most noticeable health consequences resulting from this situation were increased anxiety and sleep disorders [3], which had consequences on the effectiveness of the assigned functions and the productivity of workers [4], [5]. In addition, the abrupt change to teleworking affected the daily work obligations of the worker since they had to face the difficulties of the family environment and other events that impacted the development of their work responsibilities [6]. Due to this situation , managers developed new strategies with the help of technology to ensure employee productivity under the condition of teleworking [2], [7]. As a result, the flexibility of working from home became a new way of operating for many workers and a new work culture for organizations that, in some cases, extended beyond the mandatory restrictions and continued after the restart economy and the decrease in the post-pandemic health crisis [8].  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {In recent years, organizations have expanded the number and types of work–life policies they offer in an attempt to attract and retain talent. We challenge the assumption that work–life policies uniformly signal personal-life support and elicit favorable employee attitudes by investigating a relatively new work–life policy: egg freezing coverage. We theorize that, relative to other work–life policies, egg freezing coverage is more likely to send signals that evoke negative employee attitudes; although framed as intended to support employees’ personal lives, employees interpret egg freezing as signaling that personal-life sacrifice and work prioritization are encouraged, which in turn decrease policy support and organizational attraction. We test these ideas in six studies, including an archival study, a qualitative survey study, a scale development study, two quantitative survey studies, and an experiment. We find egg freezing coverage evokes more negative attitudes than a range of other work–life policies (in vitro fertilization [IVF], on-site childcare, paid parental leave, flextime) as well as no policy at all. More negative reactions to egg freezing than to other policies are driven by perceptions that the policy sends a stronger signal that personal-life sacrifice is encouraged, as well as perceptions that it offers fewer benefits to employees and is more costly to organizations. In all, this work expands understanding of the signaling effects of work–life policies and demonstrates that reactions to a range of work–life policies are both more variable and driven by a larger number of underlying factors than prior theory can account for © 2022 American Psychological Association},

Yet, it is still unclear how these new work practices (e.g. unassigned-desk policies; self-managing teams; telework) may affect the inclusion of people with disabilities (PWD). The framework developed in this paper theorizes the mechanisms through which NWW can enable or disable PWD's work outcomes (i.e. work-impairment coordination, perceptions of justice, isolation and privacy concerns). Additionally, we use the ideal worker concept to reason that, when combined, NWW practices create expectations for employees that can be incompatible with how PWD are often stereotypically perceived in the workplace.

	abstract = {Having a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can cause significant professional strain for parents. Compared to parents of typically developing children or children with other types of special needs, parents of children with ASD report being underemployed, having more difficulty accomplishing important work tasks or taking on new work assignments, and being viewed less favorably by supervisors. They also may be more likely to perceive themselves as stigmatized by coworkers, negatively impacting their abilities to develop or maintain meaningful relationships with others at work. All of these factors lead to parents of children with ASD earning less annual income than other types of parents and being more likely to experience loss of workplace motivation or lower overall job satisfaction. The negative career experiences of parents of children with ASD may also impact employers. Employees experiencing lower levels of motivation are less productive and more likely to quit their jobs, resulting in increased turnover expense. Because the number of working parents of children with ASD continues to grow as ASD rates increase, organizations would benefit from supporting parents of children with ASD through adopting flexible work-life balance policies, encouraging leaders to promote values of diversity and inclusiveness, and implementing workplace programs designed to support parents and educate coworkers. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

	abstract = {Previous research into telework and job stress is characterized by inconsistent findings and reported beneficial, nonsignificant, and dysfunctional effects of telework on employees’ job stress levels and well-being. To investigate when the effects of telework on job stress are beneficial versus dysfunctional, the study draws on telework research and cultural value theory and analyzes the moderating role of employee cultural background (i.e., individualism and power distance), the influence of which on the effects of telework is expected to be transmitted by an employee's beliefs about telework effectiveness and isolation. Although prior research analyzed the effects of telework in different occupations and industries, a very important matter has received very little attention – namely, the effects of telework on job stress across employees with different cultural backgrounds. To successfully implement telework arrangements, organizations must know whether employee cultural background influences the effectiveness of telework. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the related implementation of telework arrangements in many countries amplify the importance of understanding the influence of culture on the effects of telework on employee well-being. The hypotheses are tested through a three-wave survey study with 604 teleworkers from different countries. The results indicate that telework only reduces job stress when employees do not believe that telework will lead to social isolation. The study further expands telework research by showing that employees with high power distance scores have negative beliefs about telework, whereas employees with high individualism scores have positive beliefs about the effectiveness of telework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Drawing from work boundary theory and sociomaterial theory, this study explores what leads to technology-assisted supplemental work (TASW) expectations and how these expectations are managed in organisations. In the analysis of qualitative data collected from 20 senior-level managers from two organisations in Sri Lanka, we found that organisational norms developed through top management influence led to TASW expectations among lower-level managers. These expectations are then imposed by managers, and nonresponses are controlled by means of confrontations and punishments. These punitive regimes could especially create discriminative effects on married female employees if they cannot meet the after-hour expectations due to gender roles associated with the home domain. However, having formal policy guidelines on TASW could reduce the negative consequences on employees. This study contributes to the literature by including the managerial perspective on TASW expectations. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The idea that innovations enable organisations to enjoy adaptive, competitive, and generative advantages has become widely accepted. This recognition has seen many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) add innovation policy to their national policy frameworks. However, most LMICs continue to experience economic stagnation and low productivity growth amid calls for deeper theoretical and practical examination of what could foster and sustain innovative work behaviour (IWB) in such settings. The study developed and tested a conditional mediation model explaining the activation of IWB with a focus on the central role of decent work. A time-lagged study design informed data collection from two probability samples. Employees self-reported using previously validated measures of the constructs in use. The study used covariance-based structural equation modelling (CBSEM) to test the mediation model. Decent work had significant, positive relationships with organisational learning and work engagement. Organisational learning and work engagement were positively and significantly associated with IWB. Work engagement and organisational learning mediated the effect of decent work on IWB. The results provide complementary insights into how decent work may transform into IWB. Leadershipseeking to better harness the innovative capabilities resident in their organisations should develop and nurture enterprise-wide, healthy workplaces anchored on the tenets of decent work. The modelled capabilities are learnable, and hence developable. We discuss the study implications and limitations. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Amidst tremendous changes in the worlds of work in light of digitalization, non-attachmental work designs, where individuals gain income without being bound by a fixed administrative attachment to an employer, hold promises of self-actualization along with threats of insecurity. Today’s technology boom and the consequent flexibility and uncertainty it brings into workers’ lives may translate into inspiring growth opportunities or overloading pressure, contingent upon mental health and wellbeing impacts. This paper first provides a conceptualization of the non-attachmental work designs of the 21st century, before proceeding to an extensive mapping of literature at their intersection with psychological health. This involves a machine-learning-driven review of 1094 scientific articles using topic modeling, combined with in-depth manual content analyses and inductive-deductive cycles of pattern discovery and category building. The resulting scholarly blueprint reveals several tendencies, including a prevalence of positive psychology concepts in research on work designs with high levels of autonomy and control, contrasted with narratives of disempowerment in service- and task-based work. We note that some psychological health issues are researched with respect to specific work designs but not others, for instance neurodiversity and the role of gender in ownership-based work, self-image and digital addiction in content-based work, and ratings-induced anxiety in platform-mediated task-based work. We also find a heavy representation of ‘heroic’ entrepreneurs, quantitative methods, and western contexts in addition to a surprising dearth of analyses on the roles of policy and technological interventions. The results are positioned to guide academics, decision-makers, technologists, and workers in the pursuit of healthier work designs for a more sustainable future. © 2024 Rashid et al.

The research explores the crucial role of ambition in causing stress among gig workers and how marital status moderates this relationship. It challenges the conventional view of ambition as merely a motivational asset, highlighting its complex impact on professional stress. It calls for further research into ambition’s role in occupational stress and emphasizes the importance of inclusive policies.

	abstract = {The urgent lockdowns introduced by many countries at the beginning of 2020 to contain the rapid diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic overturned many paradigms, significantly affecting workers’ daily routines. Since regulations, policies, habits, and practices have changed, it is legitimate to wonder what will happen, in the long run, to the high percentage of employees who used to work remotely. We analyzed flexibility in time, place, and contract, to examine the complex constellation of hybrid work arrangements through its essential and commonly understood elements (flexibility types) and their interconnections, distinguishing between workers usually based in the office and those based off-site. Adopting the Socio-Technical-System (STS) framework, the paper investigates whether and to what extent companies have changed their structures by designing new functions, roles, and services, such as a head of agile work, work-life balance policies, and psychological support services. We empirically analyze the hybrid work phenomenon through a micro-survey of indirect questions involving approximately 600 Italian respondents. Italy is an interesting analysis domain because radical changes have been introduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper presents three main theoretical advancements. First, the study advances the research on flexibility in terms of space, time, and contracts, finding different types of interdependencies with on-site and off-site working. Second, the study extends the theories on the STS framework to flexible work, identifying whether and to what extent interdependencies occur among its main components: the social structure, people, technology, and tasks of hybrid work. The STS framework has also been used to explain the evolution of organizational priorities during the pandemic phases, revealing a relationship between the new role of “head of remote/hybrid workforce” and place flexibility. Third, the paper proves micro-surveys effectiveness with indirect questions in investigating socioeconomic and organizational phenomena. From a practical point of view, the collected data show that Italian organizations need to prepare to deal with the new work scenario because new recommendations should be given to human resource departments about managing hybrid work. © 2023 The Authors},

This paper tests the hypotheses by analyzing data from 250 service workers in Indonesia responding to online questionnaires. Findings. The result shows that workers with positive affectivity respond positively to the new work measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and do not feel emotionally exhausted. Meanwhile, for the workers with negative affectivity, new work measures evoke their emotional exhaustion. Research implications for practice. The present study suggests that service workers with negative affectivity are prone to negative consequences amidst the crisis, hence managers should pay more attention to them. Further, this study suggests the organization initiate training and development programs regarding service delivery during the crisis, as the quality of services given by the workers are at risk during the crisis.

We ask instead how individual workers interact with temporal rhythms to sustain the conditions that make their work possible-not aligning rhythms, but attuning them. This paper draws on interviews with farmer-knowledge workers, people who engage with both farm work (the work of growing food or raising animals for food, on a commercial or non-commercial basis) and computer-based knowledge work. We identify three ways that farmer-knowledge workers interact with natural and structural rhythms to construct sustainable work-lives: Anchoring (tying oneself to a particular rhythm to create accountability and structure), decoupling (loosening or cutting ties with a rhythm to create flexibility), and gap-filling (interweaving complementary rhythms to create balance). Together, these practices constitute attunement work.  © 2022 ACM.},

However, the expectation about the fulfillment of employer obligations and promises (regardless of what these obligations may be) seems to be the same.

	abstract = {Purpose: Micro and small enterprises (MSE) play a critical role in the Swiss economy but had no meaningfully adopted working from home (WFH) policy before the COVID-19 crisis. The timing of the study’s data collection allowed a unique assessment of Swiss MSEs’ adoption of WFH enabled by the adoption of digital technologies due to the first government-mandated COVID-19 lockdown. The study also set out to assess the permanence of any changes in the adoption of WFH by MSEs after initial government COVID-19 restrictions ended. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a threefold theoretical framework combining social, technical and spatial dimensions. Data were collected via telephone interviews. The utilised sampling frame included 153,000 small businesses with 4–49 employees, and the realised sample for the study was 503 interviews with MSE owners and managing directors (MDs). Findings: The Swiss government’s COVID-19 crisis lockdown policies accelerated the digital transformation of work by employees in Swiss MSEs by increasing the number of employees WFH. However, the number of MSEs with WFH employees decreased after the first lockdown ended. Small business leadership is an important influence on the persistence of any increases in WFH. Originality/value: The data collection uniquely captures the effects of externally driven digital transformation of work in small businesses by the adoption of WFH. The findings show that small businesses can rapidly learn new ways of working and support the claim that Swiss MSE MDs play a critical role in the adoption of WFH. They also confirm the importance of digital leadership and culture for realising the potential of WFH in small businesses. © 2024, Marc K.

Most workplace learning is basically informal and occurs through daily-work routines, peer-to-peer interactions, and networking, and typically brings about signifi cant positive outcomes to both individuals and organizations. Yet, workplace learning always occurs in a predefi ned context and this context has recently changed. Hereafter, many people have been delegated to work from home or any other remote location. Many employees would like to maintain remote or hybrid work design in the future, as well. In this research monograph, the authors explore an unexplored topic in social science research concerning proactive employee development through informal learning in new ways of working (NWW).

This paper examines the working conditions in critical jobs based on representative data from the German BAuA Working Time Survey 2019. Our analyses reveal that essential workers are more likely to perform unskilled or semiskilled activities and work in cleaning, transport and logistics, health care occupations as well as IT and natural science services. Regarding the working conditions, essential workers are paid comparatively less and are more physically proximate to others at work than nonessential workers. They more often work atypical hours, such as day and night shifts and on weekends, and have less autonomy in their working time. Additionally, critical jobs are characterised by muscular and skeletal strain due to working positions and carrying heavy loads significantly more often. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that work-related risks accumulate in critical jobs. © 2022, The Author(s).},

However, these challenges afford opportunities to critically examine the various facets of AI systems as they interface with human resources. To that end, we systematically review the literature at the intersection of AI and human resource management (HRM). Using the configurational approach, we identify the evolution of different theme based causal configurations in conceptual and empirical research and the outcomes of AI-HRM interaction.

Due to its complexity, this corpus appears as an indubitable labyrinth. However, it is unnecessary to be perplexed by this maze. It can be exited and the contributions hidden within it can be of value. This article presents a literature review of three different and related objectives: (a) to investigate the different conceptualizations and terminologies used for analyzing workplace arrangements (research streams), (b) to analyze the results of the individual streams to identify elements of overlapping and differentiation while tracing the connections between them, and (c) to identify future research guidelines for single streams and the entire field. We analyzed 344 academic publications. Our qualitative content analysis of the articles allows us to investigate the peculiarities of each research stream and grasp the relationships between them. We supplemented our analysis using Leximancer, a conceptual mapping tool. This article contributes heightened clarity in the complex research field of workplace arrangements. We provide a map of research streams assisting researchers to move across the labyrinth and introduces redesigned research avenues for the purpose of sharing insights and progressing straightforwardly. Increasing clarity within the field allows fellow researchers' contributions to be more accessible to practitioners, reducing their effort in finding relevant work and researchers. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {People pursuing careers outside organizations often face a career progression paradox: they must develop expertise to find new work opportunities, but such expertise is largely acquired through accumulating work experience to which they seldom have access. Research has proposed that progressive role expansion—starting one’s career specialized in a single work role and later expanding into new work roles—would be helpful to navigate this challenge. However, we propose that when women engage in lateral role expansion within professional careers, they face a “glass wall”—an invisible barrier that limits their work opportunities due to a gendered evaluation of role expansion. Specifically, role expansion by female (vs. male) freelancers is seen as less agentic, and such difference undermines female freelancers’ perceived competence and commitment. Three studies using different methods (archival data and experiment), industries (music and film), and samples (Korean and American) show that female (vs. male) freelancers who expand into new work roles are seen as less agentic and have less chance of finding new work opportunities. Although women who pursue careers outside of organizations may become unshackled from gender biases embedded within traditional organizational hierarchies, we suggest that they still face obstacles in the new forms of work.

	abstract = {The present meta-analysis tests how cost- and people-oriented strategic interventions impact temporal-dynamic changes in unit-level job attitudes within organizations. Analyses are based on 573 effect sizes across 137 longitudinal studies containing unit-level change in job attitudes across three time periods (pre-change, during change, and post-change). Results reveal that unit-level job attitudes (a) decline during cost-oriented changes (e.g., restructuring) and remain at lower levels following the changes (supporting a sustained change model); (b) increase during people-oriented changes (i.e., HRM investments) and remain at higher levels following the interventions (consistent with a sustained change model); and (c) remain unchanged over time when cost- and people-oriented interventions are combined. Tests of a process model further reveal that cost-oriented (people-oriented) interventions impact unit-level job attitudes by reducing (increasing) perceived support (relative to a no intervention control). The pattern of findings suggests that long-term, unit-level change in job attitudes can be anticipated to follow from strategic interventions, although some of the negative impact of cost cutting can be mitigated by maintaining perceptions of support. © 2021 The Authors.

In light of this main objective, based on the current state of research, the study develops a maturity model to assess the SW organizational readiness (SWOR). The SWOR maturity model consists of three dimensions, each of them further detailed into two sub-dimensions. A tool was developed to make use of the model. Design/methodology/approach: The SWOR maturity model was converted into a Web-based questionnaire that includes 54 questions based on 44 items to operationalize the model sub-dimensions. The questionnaire was used in a survey conducted at the Local Health Authority (ASL) of the province of Bari (Italy). Findings: Several implications derive from the present study. From a managerial perspective, the SWOR maturity model supports companies in the as-is analysis of processes, technologies and human resources, which are the enablers of an effective SW, and in the development of a roadmap to achieve a desired “to-be” situation. Originality/value: Despite recent studies on SW have identified the key drivers that affect the success of SW implementation, there is a lack of models and tools that help companies become aware of the actions and investments to be taken to move towards an effective SW adoption. Even the analysis of the literature on maturity models reveals a gap in the research related to the assessment of SW organizational readiness. The present paper tries to overcome these limitations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

By conducting semi-structured interviews with all employees and the CEO, the paper explores, how social, organisational and individual factors influence the ability of employees to improve their subjective well-being through reduced working hours. The results indicate that the effects of mandated schedule changes are less about increased freedom from work and more about the ability to engage in personally meaningful activities. Interviews revealed four dimensions of well-being: temporal harmony, social involvement, advancement and autonomy. While the majority reported improved well-being, particularly in terms of temporal harmony and strengthened social ties, barriers such as misaligned schedules, rigid working hours and limited external support hindered improvements in well-being. The paper also describes the different perspectives of the manager and the employees on the changes implemented. Recognising potential factors and considering different aspects of working time reduction and employee well-being can help organisations use their working time policies to maximise the well-being of their employees in terms of not only the quantity but also the quality of their leisure time. This study adds to our understanding of the impact of reduced working time on individual and societal well-being. © The Author(s) 2024.},

With capitalism, urbanisation, mass media, education and migration increasing throughout Asia, now is a time of flux in opportunities and subjectivities. Such changes are lived as deeply personal and relational. Young people are often instrumental to familial ‘development’ strategies, and this effects divisions of labour, norms of moral economy, life course ideals and distributions of power. At the same time, media, education and development discourses often exhort people to author autonomous destinies through entrepreneurialism, career and consumerism. Contributors to this issue, ‘Development, Gender and Intergenerational Aspirations in Asia’, ethnographically explore how old and new dreams—some emphasising autonomy, while others stress familial obligation—conjoin, elide and compete, and how people negotiate associated life course expectations. We also show how dreams find limits, requiring redreaming and rerouting. © 2021 The Australian National University.},

	abstract = {Digital technologies brought about by digitalization have transformed the characteristics and expectations of the workforce. These technologies have also played an important role in the restructuring the labor markets, and this structure has significantly affected labor preferences by accelerating remote work, which became widespread with the Covid 19 pandemic that started in 2021. The wave or movement of 'Great Resignation' that started in the United States (USA) refers to a labor movement that emerged with the decision of many employees to quit their jobs and subsequently gained global quality. Although it is stated in some sources that the main reason for the Great Resignation movement is the pandemic, according to some other sources, the main trigger of this great strike is the digital technologies that are more involved in our lives, especially after the 2000s. The pandemic has only accelerated this process. First put forward by Anthony Klotz, an academician at Texas A&M University in May 2021, the quits that led to the Great Wave of Resignation, also known as the "Great Exit, Great Displacement, or Great Awakening" by some circles, are seen as a movement of employees who want to work with different expectations in new work environments under redefined working conditions. Although the emotional dimension of this movement created by the pandemic seems to have led employees whose family ties have strengthened to seek new jobs where they can establish a greater work-life balance, the defense of this study is that the origin of this movement is based on the digitalization that started before the pandemic and revealed all these expectations. The study examines the causes of the Great Wave of Resignation, which has not yet received enough attention in the national literature and emerged as a result of the change in labor preferences, on the theoretical basis, and aims to shed light on future research in this respect. © 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper involved 60 Italian SMEs of various sectors and 330 employees: 217 clerks (average age 42) and 113 managers (average age 48) belonging to different functional units and with a different education backgrounds. Two different questionnaires, one addressed to clerks and one to managers/executives who coordinate the remote working activity, were prepared and sent. This paper investigates the issues of perceived productivity, technological preparation, coordination, programming and control with specific attention to how the participants faced the remote working experience from the learning point of view. Findings: Before the pandemic, Italian SMEs did not feel the necessity to adopt a structured policy on remote working. The COVID-19 emergency has forced them to consider that working remotely is possible and can produce benefits and positive results for what they learned in terms of autonomy, motivation and trust, to the detriment of physical presence, which is not as fundamental to ensure productivity. Originality/value: While large, formalized and structured companies encountered modest difficulties being already technologically and culturally prepared for remote working, the big challenge was that of SMEs, who found themselves obliged to adopt it. This paper examines how Italian SMEs lived and evaluated the switch to a new work organization and turned it into an occasion for workplace learning. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Among academics, the opportunity to telework has been embraced by most, but it is unclear how it relates to their health and well-being. The aim of this study was to determine how frequency and amount of telework is associated with perceived health, stress, recuperation, work-life balance, and intrinsic work motivation among teaching and research academics. An electronic questionnaire was sent to junior lecturers, senior lecturers, and professors at Swedish public universities. It included the General Health Questionnaire, Work Stress Questionnaire, items for assessing recuperation, the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction at Work scale, and parts of Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, as well as questions about the frequency and amount of telework performed. In total, 392 academics responded to the survey. Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences between groups of academics with different telework frequency (p < 0.05). Univariate analyses of variance showed that ratings of stress related to indistinct organization and conflicts were higher among academics that telework several times per week or more than among academics that telework less than once per month. In regression analyses of associations between amount of telework (in hours per week) and the dependent variables, no significant effects were found. Although it cannot be concluded whether stress is a cause or an effect of frequent telework, the findings warrant further attention to academics who telework frequently. © 2020, The Author(s).},

While the first method provided summary point estimates that calculated the average effect of the explanatory variables for the “average employee”, the second approach allowed us to focus on the effects explanatory variables have on the entire conditional distribution of the response variables, taking into account that this effect can be different for employees with different levels of performance. Job autonomy, engagement, communication skills, trust in co-workers, occupational self-efficacy, and family-work conflict, significantly influence both social and technical performance.

	abstract = {Poor work-life balance (WLB) has been linked to negative outcomes such as increased stress, anxiety, depression, and a perceived reduction in the overall quality of life. At an institutional level, these may include lowered employee commitment and decreased productivity at work. The advent of COVID-19 has necessitated fundamental alterations to work experience and the ways in which WLB may be perceived. This phenomenological study employed qualitative, in-depth interviews to explore higher education academics’ lived experiences of remote working and how they perceived this had impacted their well-being (WB) and WLB. Using purposive samplings, respondents were drawn from HE sectors in the Netherlands, and the UK. The findings offered an understanding of how remote and hybrid teaching delivery during the pandemic affected academics’ actual experiences of WB and WLB. These findings serve to enhance policymakers’ understandings of significant occupational health and WB issues within a post-pandemic education service paradigm. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {New working modalities such as smart working have removed the constraints of time and place and turned the traditional concept of work into a highly flexible phenomenon that can now be conducted anywhere through digital tools and an array of new technologies. After having experienced it in an unprecedented rate worldwide, following the Covid-19 pandemic, many companies have vowed that these new work configurations are here to stay and will become increasingly common. Organizations will continue to embrace them as a way of improving employees’ satisfaction and revolutionizing operations. Despite the benefits often associated with the new ways of work, evidence shows that many companies have struggled to cope with it. In light of the complexity of such adoption, we investigate through a longitudinal case study of a multinational company that embraced such initiatives before, during and after the pandemic, the main challenges and difficulties voiced by both managers and employees. The analysis of the findings shows that the main issues relate to excessive supervision, longer working hours, change of team dynamics and insufficient use of technologies—all of which call for a change in organizational culture and approach towards new ways of working that goes beyond changes in individual tasks and work practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

This two-phase (2002–2006, 2015–2019) study addresses this question by examining how middle managers perceive the spatio-temporal boundaries of their work to have shifted. Typically, such managers report change occurring in two directions: (i) the contractual employment boundary becoming stretched as hours completed inside the workplace increase; and (ii) this boundary becoming breached as managers conduct additional work voluntarily from locations outside corporate premises. Although such trends can be explained deterministically – the former stemming from corporate acceptance of consultancy-influenced organizational prescriptions (business process reengineering, lean management, agile management etc.), and the latter from widespread adoption of digital communication innovations (BlackBerry, email, WhatsApp etc.) – we argue that to achieve a more rounded appreciation of such work ‘extensification’ attention must also be paid to agentic forces of strategic and political choice. Developing this argument, and acknowledging paradox when theorizing spatio-temporal change, we suggest future research on managerial employment must entail documenting not only factors influencing the stretching and breaching of work boundaries, but also – given incipient political regulations and innovative surveillance technologies – others serving to strengthen and protect them, notably those directed at improving work–life balance and physical/psychological health. © The Author(s) 2021.},

This SI seeks to offer a reflection on and contribution to deeper understanding of ongoing flexibilization, virtualization and mediation of work practices. The authors go on to contextualize and discuss the contributions of the papers included in this special issue, focussing on significant technological, spatiotemporal, organizational and individual developments associated with new ways of working. Finally, they reflect on the possible relevance of the recent Covid-19 pandemic for the future of work, arguing that this pandemic accelerated NWW in many ways and – given the many paradoxical NWW dynamics and developments – that there could very well be unexpected and adverse consequences, including a turn away from formal ways of working. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose that millennials – those born between 1980 and 1995 – are uniquely impacted by the long-term impact of the pandemic, which has accelerated the work from home movement and exacerbated organizational issues associated with working remotely. Millennials, on the cusp of embarking on important leadership roles in this new remote work environment, pose challenges and opportunities for organizations will that will last long after the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a viewpoint based on a narrative review and on the authors’ professional experiences within organizations. Based upon these findings, this paper has reimagined the Mumford skills model to explore millennial managers in this new remote work, post-pandemic context. The goal of this narrative review was to provide a full picture of the “Millennial manager” and the challenges they face in becoming effective managers, as well as highlight the important strengths they bring to the table. Findings: Managers may have challenges regarding job satisfaction, productivity and organizational commitment. The positive factors are millennials prefer flexibility, teamwork and creating a positive work-life balance. The negative side has to do with isolation and the ability to embrace the organization culture in a remote environment. This model shows positive and limiting factors of millennials related to organization effectiveness. The major propositions and model were that millennium managers in this new environment increase interpersonal communication to maintain trust, effective mentoring, resolve strong organizational culture and ensure effective delegation and conflict resolution. Practical implications: This study discovered challenges for managers, including developing loyalty and improving employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Active listening is necessary for team management to show that all team members are valued irrespective of the work environment. Active listening and empathy will increase social support at work, which improves personal well-being and productivity. Millennials will continue to use their technological skills, their desire for teamwork and their preference for participative management, resulting in becoming an invaluable asset in this era of organizational transformation. The challenge for organizations is to realize the millennial generation possesses many talents and must successfully engage them in the pursuit of organizational goals. Originality/value: This paper adds to the body of knowledge regarding millennials in organizations with a specific focus on the new work environment created by the global pandemic. The authors hope that their adapted skills model – the millennial manager skills model – becomes an important resource for articulation this new environment that millennial managers are in and that this model can be further refined and expanded through empirical exploration. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that demographically, the presence of elders at home and employment in manufacturing were negatively associated with wellbeing. Among personal attributes, the need for structure (routines) was negatively associated with wellbeing. But the need for autonomy (volition) and job crafting to increase structural job resources (proactively obtaining more responsibility and knowledge) were positively associated with wellbeing. Wellbeing was also positively associated with job-related factors of technology and supervisor support.

Drawing on interviews with principals and representatives from principal stakeholder organisations in these four state jurisdictions, the paper identifies a number of key issues for school principals and the implications for understandings and practices of educational leadership. These include varied understandings of autonomy, practices of leadership and implications for health, workload and well-being. The paper argues that while principals have mixed perceptions of school autonomy policies, there has been a narrowing of leadership experiences by principals in the form of managerialism and compliance. Furthermore, principals continue to experience high levels of workload, and some principals, depending on career stage and experience level, feel better able to work within and sometimes against these policies in their schools and communities. These practices are sometimes felt to be despite the system and not due to school autonomy policies themselves. The implication of these findings is that principals are inequitably able to respond to and implement school autonomy policies, an issue often glossed over in educational leadership research. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Despite its growing relevance, a consistent and coherent conceptualization of hybrid work remains elusive. This article aims to address this gap by offering a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of hybrid work, contributing to conceptual clarity in its application. We draw on an extensive literature review to propose a definition of hybrid work that encompasses dynamic switches across three dimensions: modality (analog/face-to-face vs. digital/virtual), location (office/co-located vs. non-office/distributed), and temporality (constrained/synchronous vs. unconstrained/asynchronous). Building on existing literature and our dynamic, three-dimensional, and multilevel definition of hybrid work, we reinterpret key findings within the HRM domain, illustrating how our framework brings clarity to previously ambiguous aspects of hybrid work. This reinterpretation not only underscores the theoretical contributions of our definition but also identifies new research directions inspired by these insights. © 2024 The Authors},

A focus on praxis enables systems thinking, ultimately supporting a shift in WOP research processes to be more relevant and impactful, and creating genuine, enduring, evidence-based change. We argue for integrated and recursive engagement across three areas. First is dialog, to identify and engage stakeholders to develop a relevant and impactful problem statement. Dialog feeds into and stimulates knowledge generation which includes engaging in research and gathering an understanding of what is already known from WOP (including what is unique about our perspectives). Finally, dissemination is about finding novel ways to share our knowledge with stakeholders, including practitioners, academics and through education, and in doing so links back to dialog, because meaningful engagement in dissemination prompts identification of new problem statements to be explored through knowledge generation. Throughout the chapter collaboration with community partners and policymakers around the living wage is used as an example of how this dynamic, interconnected and multilevel framework can operate in practice. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.},

Drawing on 146 interviews and more than 300 weekly diaries in two professional service firms, we develop a framework centered on the emerging concept of optimal busyness, an attractive, short-lived temporal experience that people try to reproduce/prolong because it makes them feel energized and productive as well as in control of their time. Our findings show that individuals continuously navigate between different temporal experiences separated by a fine line, quiet time, optimal busyness, and excessive busyness, and that optimal busyness that they strive for is a fragile and fleeting state difficult to achieve and maintain. We show that these temporal experiences are the effect of the temporality of controls—that is, the ability of controls to shape professionals’ temporal experience through structuring, rarefying, and synchronizing temporality. Moreover, we find that professionals who regularly face high temporal pressures seek to cope with these by attempting to construct/prolong optimal busyness through manipulating the pace, focus, and length of their temporal experiences, a process we call control of temporality.

	abstract = {Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 pushed organizations towards the adoption of new ways of organizing the workplace, to contrast the diffusion of the virus as well as to ensure the production of goods and services. Many workers and employers were suddenly forced to switch to forms of remote work, quite often without any real preparation to successfully deal with these changes. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the point of view of Italian HR managers on the introduction of these new ways of working in Italian SMEs, to underline both the advantages and risks of remote work and to provide a shared list of best and worst practices related to remote work adoption. A Panel of 19 Italian experts of HR management was recruited in April 2022 to perform a Delphi study. They were asked to take part in an anonymous and asynchronous discussion started with stimulus questions, on their remote working experience during the pandemic. A mixed-methods approach was adopted for data collection and analysis. Results: Five principal themes emerged, related to both the positive and negative implications of the adoption of hybrid and remote work, namely: work-life balance, environmental sustainability, impact of working life on individual wellbeing and health, and technological improvement. The content analysis was realized with the use of the T-Lab software, stressing the risks of inaccurate planning and management of these new ways of work. Conclusions: This is the first application of a Delphi study in the Italian context on the impact of COVID-19 on work-life transformative processes. The results highlight the importance of clear communication, transparency, trust, and technology in successfully implementing remote and hybrid forms of work. By implementing these best practices, organizations can create a work environment that supports remote and hybrid work, fosters collaboration, and maintains productivity. The findings of this study can serve as a useful guide for organizations that are transitioning to remote or hybrid work models. © 2023 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: Online survey data were collected from 234 flight attendants who work for five low-cost airlines based in Thailand. The data were analyzed by using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that trust in an organization and trait mindfulness are negatively associated with the perceived stress of flight attendants. Their associations are also partially mediated by optimism. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis reveals that trait mindfulness intensifies the positive association between trust in organizations and optimism. Originality/value: The evidence from this research broadens COR theory by showing that different aspects of resources can be combined to strengthen the ability of individuals to gain more resources to lessen stress. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Organizations are increasingly introducing new work arrangements triggered by fast-paced knowledge acquisition, exponential technological growth, and demographic changes. Even though many studies have provided an in-depth understanding of how technology changed individual forms of modern work (e.g. virtual teams, shared leadership, remote work), the field needs a broader view of what constitutes technology-driven work arrangements and why they are implemented in organizations. The purpose of our paper is to systematically review, structure, and integrate the empirical evidence on current research on technology-driven work arrangements and to identify blind spots, which will serve as a springboard for the further development of the field. Based on our understanding of technology-driven work arrangements as flexible approaches to work within and beyond organizational boundaries that result from technology-driven transformation processes characterized by intensified spread, speed, and depth, we identify 191 studies that meet our inclusion criteria and organize them into six thematic clusters. We integrate our findings into an overarching framework based on complexity theory. We argue that three thematic clusters identified in our systematic literature review (organizational architectures across boundaries, knowledge integration processes across boundaries, and flexible employment relations across organizational boundaries) address an organization’s need for external flexibility. In contrast, three other clusters (virtual teams within organizations, virtual communication processes within organizations, and enhancement of self-responsibility of organizational actors) address internal flexibility needs, reflecting the overall goal of technology-driven work arrangements to achieve internal and external flexibility via coordinated and consistent patterns of action across all clusters. We additionally highlight underexplored research opportunities and provide promising avenues for future research. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Consistent with previous literature in the field of comparative HRM, we find that the three gender equality perspectives explain significant differences in the HRM chain as well as in both individual-level and organizational-level outcomes. Extending comparative HRM literature, we find that the three gender equality perspectives influence our research community differently, show similarities and differences in outcomes, associate with different effects (i.e., enabling and enhancing), and differ in the direction of such effects.

Only a radical restructuring of both work and care can redress all these problems. We propose new norms: no one does paid work for more than 30 hours a week, and everyone contributes roughly 22 hours of unpaid care to family, friends, or their chosen community of care. Other approaches provide only partial solutions. For example, wages for housework, or excellent daycare, or flexible work hours would not overcome the care/policy divide. We explain why everyone needs to acquire the knowledge and dispositions that come from the sustained experience of providing care throughout one's life. We show how work can be transformed to allow time for care giving, and how these new norms will generate a cultural shift in the value accorded care. While we focus primarily on human-to-human care, we include care for the earth. The final two chapters describe how these processes of transformation could be feasibly accomplished and why these changes are possible in high-income countries within our current global economy. Every one of our proposals already exists in at least one country; the task is to integrate the key reforms and scale them up. Given the magnitude of the current problems, deep changes are needed.

This literature review aims to compile and synthesize previous research regarding the importance of managers and leaders for employee well-being and their work performance when work is carried out from home. The purpose is also to relate these findings to previous reviews when work was performed on-site. Six leadership behaviours are identified as central when working from home. The leader should 1) communicate and promote the use of technology for communication, 2) regularly check, provide feedback and steer towards business goals, 3) show trust in the employee and give autonomy, 4) show support and empathy, 5) encourage and promote health, and 6) balance the need of individual employee with the need of the workgroup. There is little to suggest that leadership exercised when working from home differs from that exercised in a regular on-site workplace. What does seem to vary are the tools used to exercise leadership. More high-quality longitudinal research is needed that examines the importance of leadership over an extended period, considers how often work is performed from home, and combines different data sources and data collection methods. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The present study provides evidence for a valid and reliable tool, the Academic Quality at Work Tool (AQ@workT), to investigate the quality of life at work in academics within the Italian university sector. The AQ@workT was developed by the QoL@Work research team, namely a group of expert academics in the field of work and organizational psychology affiliated with the Italian Association of Psychologists. The tool is grounded in the job demands-resources model and its psychometric properties were assessed in three studies comprising a wide sample of lecturers, researchers, and professors: a pilot study (N = 120), a calibration study (N = 1084), and a validation study (N = 1481). Reliability and content, construct, and nomological validity were supported, as well as measurement invariance across work role (researchers, associate professors, and full professors) and gender. Evidence from the present study shows that the AQ@workT represents a useful and reliable tool to assist university management to enhance quality of life, to manage work-related stress, and to mitigate the potential for harm to academics, particularly during a pandemic. Future studies, such as longitudinal tests of the AQ@workT, should test predictive validity among the variables in the tool. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Growth of HR technologies has coincided with the rise of remote work, yet the role of technology providers in driving demand is under-researched. Through a frame analysis of the marketing content on six HR technology websites, this article elucidates how technology providers frame algorithmic management and the frame effects for work, employees, managers, and the relations between them. The findings demonstrate that HR technology websites adopt the language of espionage to frame algorithmic management as a managerial imperative required to prevent organisational risks posed by unproductive employees. Applying a labour process lens, this paper demonstrates how the framing exploited tensions in labour–capital relations to place employees and managers in opposing positions, encouraging, and constructing an antagonistic employment relationship. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Objectives: Particular attention was given to employees in critical infrastructures or essential occupations at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. These occupations are of particular importance in maintaining supplies and public order. Many employees in essential occupations were already faced with heavy demands on their time before the pandemic. The aim of this article is to identify the working time profiles of these employees. Methods: The working time conditions of employees in essential occupations before the pandemic are analysed on the basis of the BAuA Working Time Survey 2019. In order to identify the occupational groups, reference is made to an established categorisation of essential occupations (cf. Koebe et al. 2020). The two groups are then contrasted in terms of differences in the organisation of working time. Results: There is greater heterogeneity in the length of working hours in essential occupations. This group is characterised in particular by shortened rest periods and working time schedules. Atypical working hours (e.g. shift work and night work) and work at weekends (especially on Sundays and public holidays) are more likely to indicate that occupations are essential. In addition, there is a significantly higher incidence of on-call duties. At the same time, employees in essential occupations have less working time autonomy and work less often from home. Conclusions: Overall, a more negative stress profile in terms of working hours emerges for employees in essential occupations compared to nonessential ones, as the services provided must be available 24/7. In order to increase resilience for future times of crisis and to ensure the health, performance and safety of employees in essential occupations, working time conditions should be improved. This could also counteract the low attractiveness of these occupations in the long term, especially against the background of the shortage of skilled workers (cf. KOFA 2020). © 2021 Alfons W.

New Work in coworking-spaces provides several advantages for sustainability and knowledge creation, yet it also faces competition and knowledge leakage risks. To understand the nexus of knowledge transfer and sustainability in New Work, we study the processes in coworking-spaces through interviews, observations, and secondary data. We compare environments with low- and high-sustainability targets of coworking-spaces. The results reveal that coworking-spaces can prime their audiences by exposing sustainability in their manifestos, communities, and physical spaces. Knowledge-sharing occurs in different zones of coworking-spaces in the forms of inspiration, problem-solving, synthesizing, and co-creation. The sustainability of coworking-spaces and knowledge-sharing therein is influenced by a shared community nested in the local environment. We develop a model of knowledge creation processes depending on the exposure of a coworking-space's sustainability targets. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Resources that individuals acquire at work can have significant effects on their own well-being and family satisfaction, and on those of their closest family relations. Following the conservation of resources theory, this study examined the effects of work-to-family enrichment (WFE) on psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) and family satisfaction (SWFaL) in different-gender dual-earner parents. The sample consisted of 473 couples – mother and father – from Temuco, Chile, who answered the Work-Family Interface scale, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Family Scale. The analysis was conducted using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). Results showed that WFE was positively associated with SWFaL for both mothers and fathers (actor effects), whereas higher WFE was linked to lower psychological distress only in fathers. For mothers and fathers, psychological distress was negatively associated with their own (actor effects) and the other parent's SWFAL (partner effects). The mediating role of psychological distress was found only for fathers' WFE and their SWFaL. These results indicate that resources from work can increase family satisfaction for both fathers and mothers in dual-earner couples with adolescent children. However, in these couples, fathers acquire affective resources (positive mood) that reduce their own psychological distress, while mothers acquire skills (managing time at home more efficiently) that they invest directly in the family domain. © 2022 Scandinavian Psychological Associations and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The effects of leaders’ personal and workplace resources on their health and work–life balance have often slipped under the radar, as most studies are directed outwardly and focus on follower outcomes. With this study, we closed a gap in the research and investigated the positive effects of remote work, autonomy, and leaders’ core-self evaluations (CSE) on two important leader outcomes: health and work–life balance. We hypothesized that the relationship between remote work and the outcomes would be moderated by leaders’ CSE and their autonomy—in such a way that leaders with lower resources benefit more from remote work and achieve better health and work–life balance the more days they spend working from home. A sample of 367 leaders reported their frequency of working from home, their autonomy, and CSE. Their health and work–life balance were assessed five months later. Results showed a moderating effect of CSE on both outcomes, indicating that leaders with low CSE benefit more in terms of health and work–life balance. There was no moderating effect of autonomy. Leaders with high resources (autonomy and CSE) had overall higher levels of health and work–life balance regardless of work location. Practitioners in organizations should consider working from home as a resource for leaders, particularly if personal resources are lower. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Neoliberalism has transformed work, welfare and democracy. However, its impacts, and its future, are more complex than we often imagine. Alongside growing inequality, social spending has been rising. Politics, Inequality and the Australian Welfare State After Liberalisation asks how we understand this contradictory politics and what opportunities exist to create a more equal society. It argues an older welfare state politics, driven by the power of industrial labour, is giving way to political contests led by workers within the welfare state itself. Advancing more equal social policy, though, requires new forms of statecraft, or ways of doing policy, as well as new models of organising. Drawing on examples of social policy change since the 1980s, the book explores how seemingly similar reforms reflect distinct political dynamics and facilitate different social outcomes. The examples reflect the main aspects of liberalisation - conditionality of benefits, marketisation of services and financialisation of the life course. Across each domain, it identifies examples that fit the 'neoliberal' frame and alternatives that appear to subvert it. From family payments to Medicare, social protection advanced using remarkably similar policy tools to those associated with liberalisation. The book identifies two competing welfare state projects. A 'dual welfare state' of hidden subsidies to privatised welfare alongside increasingly residualised public systems that stigmatise recipients, and a 'hybrid' model of marketised universalism that uses novel forms of statecraft to socialise risk while advancing competition. Rather than explaining how Australia fell prey to neoliberalism, the book identifies an ongoing struggle between competing visions of liberalisation. Dual welfare deepens inequality by concealing the distributional effects of state policy, building a sizeable coalition of largely older voters, insulated from the insecurities of precarious work and benefiting from rising house prices. Hybrid policies, it argues, emerged at the intersection of sympathetic bureaucracies and strong social pressure. Central to both are workers within the welfare state and the unions that represent them. The analysis recasts divides based on generation and education as reflecting the increasingly central role of social reproduction within the paid economy, and the strategies of care workers to have their skills and value recognised. The analysis opens opportunities for new models of solidarity based on an ethic of care. © 2023 Ben Spies-Butcher. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {People undergoing career transitions often bring aspects of old roles into their new work contexts, and this interface can create conflict between lingering aspects of one's work self and the newer aspects of one's work self. Yet, we know little about how this conflict between old and new selves shapes employee outcomes. We examine this issue among ex-entrepreneurs—individuals who have transitioned from a business owner to a wage employee. Drawing from role identity theory, we develop a model of the consequences of conflict between a lingering entrepreneur identity and a current work role identity. We propose that ex-entrepreneurs who experience higher levels of identity conflict will be more likely to experience burnout and less likely to engage in boosterism of their employer, and that these relationships are explained by lower levels of perceived professional identity growth (i.e., progressive identity). We further suggest that the negative effect of conflict on progressive identity is exacerbated by nostalgia for one's entrepreneurial past. In a three-stage field survey of ex-entrepreneurs and their romantic partners, we found support for these hypotheses using both partner-rated outcomes and self-rated outcomes. We discuss implications for the literature on entrepreneurship careers and work identity in organizations. © 2023 The Authors. Personnel Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Applying Conservation of Resources theory, we explore the impact of ‘resource caravans’ on ‘work–family balance’ and subsequent ‘well-being’ in a sample of 446 remote workers. Our findings contribute to ongoing sociological debates by showing exactly how flexibility and control play a role in the remote workplace. Specifically, our model revealed that ‘sense of control’ over home was most beneficial for ‘work–family balance’ among experienced remote workers who had high levels of ‘schedule flexibility’, whereas ‘work–family balance’ benefited from lower levels of ‘schedule flexibility’ among new remote workers. Resources from the home domain were most critical for ‘work–family balance’, which mediated the effects of the ‘resource caravan’ from the home domain on overall employee ‘well-being’. © 2023 The Authors.

Support was found for the subprocesses that involved job control and work engagement. Flexibility was associated with more job control and work engagement which were in turn related to lower turnover intentions. That telecommuting was associated with higher work-to-family conflict and indirectly to higher turnover intentions raised questions about the net effects of flexibility.

With the advice from the Department of Fisheries Malaysia, Hulu Terengganu and Jelebu were sampled for the freshwater fisheries community, while; Manjung and Mersing were sampled for the brackishwater fisheries community in this paper. Only marital status had significantly (p<0.05) predicted highly empowered older rural women CSO leaders, which is less than a 90.5 percent likelihood of single leaders in the highly empowered groups. Among younger rural women CSO leaders, only water system had significantly (p<0.05) predicted highly empowered young women CSO leaders, which is less than 52.8 percent likelihood leaders from the fisheries community in the highly empowered group. In conclusion, married status is the indicator of the highly empowered group among older rural women CSO leaders; and the brackishwater community is the indicator of the highly empowered group among younger rural women CSO leaders in Malaysia. © 2018 Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association (MACFEA).},

	abstract = {Digital Labor, taking up flexible but small-scale employment arrangements on online intermediary platforms, with few constraints on how much, when, and where work is performed, are becoming the new work reality for many individuals. Scholars have argued that this type of work is inherently demeaning. We seek to explore the worker’s perspective and how their long-term perspective aligns or misaligns with their actual work arrangement. We draw on career construction theory and hypothesize a job–career congruence model suggesting that when workers’ cognitive presentations of their microwork as jobs or careers are incongruent, they are less likely to experience their work as meaningful. The results from a two-stage field study of 803 workers from two microworking platforms support the negative effect of an incongruent job–career schema on workers’ experience of meaningful work. Additionally, results demonstrate that even workers who are proactive in nature, seem unable to excel in these fluid work settings when their job-career schema are not aligned. Practitioner Points: Contrary to what platform organizations may expect, digital labourers view crowdworking as both a job and a career, which in turn fosters meaningfulness. Careers are important aspect in understanding digital labourers’ understanding of their jobs and careers. Keeping this in mind, we would encourage platform organizations to: provide career development opportunities, instead of focusing on short-term incentives. This would cultivate crowdworkers’ career outlook, cultivate job–career congruence, and help mediate issues related to lack of career prosperity in microwork design. recognize aspirational career elements, such as career ladders, employability, and work–life balance to reduce possible exploitation in this employment area. Focusing only on job features such as flexibility, autonomy, and rewards is insufficient to motivate and inspire meaningfulness among digital labourers. provide training focused on career adaptability.

Business leaders who set the conditions and create engaging, meaningful work through organisational design and use of the knowledge and creative potential of their workforces are engaging in smart working. In Smart Working: Creating the Next Wave, Anne Marie McEwan explains how smart working is more than just flexible and mobile working. It is about flexibility and autonomy - how people work, not just where and when. She argues that systems, working environments and governance are more likely to lead to effective performance if they maximise self-determination and choice. She describes how collaborative communication technologies create possibilities for stimulating and harnessing collective intelligence, within and beyond organisational boundaries. In short, smart working is an outcome of designing organisational systems that are good both for business and people. McEwan warns that the tendency to talk about new management paradigms risks overlooking insights derived from years of academic research, and particularly from lessons learned from process innovation methodology. This rigorously researched but intensely practical book examines current workplace trends relating to people, technology, place and space. It reviews what we already know about effective management and high performance work methods and shows how those insights can be used to advantage in contemporary workscapes. It will help those with responsibilities for the strategic direction of their organizations. Learning and development and HR professionals will understand how to interpret these insights for their own business. © Anne Marie McEwan 2013. All rights reserved.},

This paper engages with the following themes: Emotional Labour; Precarity of Fixed-Term Contracts; and Imposter Syndrome. Insight gleaned through the textual analysis contributes to the understanding of how academics might be navigating and negotiating the neoliberal university. In particular, we highlight the implications of contractual precarity in HE and the fragility of identity which is experienced by some academics.

First, growth modelling analyses confirmed a linear trend for the growth of vigour and decline in fatigue across the days of the intervention group, indicating a typical upward resource trajectory. No changes appeared in the control group. Mediation analyses indicated that repeatedly engaging in a daily respite intervention influenced more stable energy levels after the intervention period indirectly through the immediate changes in daily energy levels during the intervention period.

	abstract = {This paper aims to explore the ways in which nursery workers are constructed through government discourse in England. This is done by offering a deconstruction of key policy texts. The discursive construction of 'the nursery worker' within government discourses has shifted over time but currently occupies a highly politicised position. It is argued that following a decade of unprecedented policy attention and reform, the cultivation and continued promotion of a discursive 'crisis in childcare', has laid the ground for Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) to be refashioned in particular ways. Policy claims to a perpetual 'crisis in childcare' are dismantled and explored in order to better understand how nursery workers have become fabricated through texts as more or less professional at particular political moments and to what effect. Attention is drawn to the recent introduction of 'Early Years Professional Status' and claims to evidence-based policy formation are problematised. The paper concludes by considering the discursive opportunities available for alternative constructions of professionalism to take shape from within communities of ECEC practice.},

Drawing on expressions such as ‘blowing a fuse’, ‘cracking under pressure’ or ‘health MOT’, this book suggests that meanings of workplace health vary depending on how we frame the underlying purpose and function of organization. Health at Work takes some of the most powerful and taken-for-granted discourses of organization and explores what each might mean for the construction of the healthy employee. Not only does it offer a fresh and challenging approach to the topic of health at work, it also examines several core topics at the heart of contemporary research and practice, including technology, innovation, ageing and emotions. This bookmakes a timely contribution to debates about well-being at work, relevant to practitioners, policy-makers and designers of workplace health interventions, as well as academics and students. This book will be illuminating reading for students and scholars across management studies, occupational health and organizational psychology. © 2020 Leah Tomkins and Katrina Pritchard.},

New work design experiments merge wellness with productivity to measure and modulate the affective and emotional labour of resilience that is necessary to survive the turbulence of the widespread incorporation of agile management systems, in which workers are expected to take symbolic direction from machines. The Quantified Workplace project was carried out by one company that fitted sensory algorithmic devices to workers’ computers and bodies, which, this article argues, identify workers’ so-called agility and reveal management practices that track affective and emotional labour, categorized in the project as stress, subjective productivity and wellbeing. Capital’s accelerated attempts to capture more areas of work and workers’ capacities facilitate the conversion of labour power into a source of value but also results in alienation and abstraction. Participants’ resistance to participation in the Quantified Workplace reveals tensions in the labour process when affect is measured in processes of corporate change. © The Author(s) 2018.},

In Female Enterprise in the New Economy, Karen D. Hughes examines whether an increasingly entrepreneurial economy offers women better opportunities for economic success, or instead increases their risk of poverty and economic insecurity. Drawing on original data from interviews, statistical research, and other sources, Hughes explores the reasons why women are starting businesses in record numbers. She looks at the type of work that entrepreneurial women are pursuing, the satisfaction they derive from their work, and the economic risks and rewards they face. Placing this study in the context of broader debates on economic restructuring, the emergence of a ‘risk society,’ and growing economic polarization, Hughes illustrates the diversity within women’s self-employment and small business ownership, and the need for policies to better address the particular needs of this sector of the workforce. Tackling a range of issues and theoretical assumptions, Female Enterprise in the New Economy will be of interest to a wide audience in sociology, organizational studies, entrepreneurship studies, public policy, political economy, and women’s studies. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2005.},

Further, the results showed that professional identity has a positive impact on employee engagement and satisfaction and a negative impact on turnover intention. Meanwhile, employee engagement and job satisfaction have negative effects on turnover intention. In addition, we further explained the mediating role of the two variables, namely, employee engagement and job satisfaction, between professional identity and turnover intention.

Through social networking tools, people now can easily contact others for social purpose as well as for work purpose. As a result, mobile social networking tools are now blurring the boundary between work and family domains and creating a new work-life relationship. Using social networking tools for work provides a lot of benefits as well as some negative effects. In the paper, we develop two empirical studies to examine both the positive effects and negative effects of using social networking tools for work. Our finding indicates that using social networking tools increases group effectiveness, which results in improvement of group identity. Nevertheless, using social networking tools for work also blurs the boundary of work-life, which may raise the work load and work-home conflict. We concluded that both academics and practice should pay attention to and minimize the negative impact of increased work overload and work-home conflict induced by using social networking tools for work.

Previous research has not been able to assess whether workplace policies or initiatives succeed in reducing work-family conflict or increasing work-family fit. Using longitudinal data collected from 608 employees of a white-collar organization before and after a workplace initiative was implemented, we investigate whether the initiative affects work-family conflict and fit, whether schedule control mediates these effects, and whether work demands, including long hours, moderate the initiative's effects on work-family outcomes. Analyses clearly demonstrate that the workplace initiative positively affects the work-family interface, primarily by increasing employees' schedule control. This study points to the importance of schedule control for our understanding of job quality and for management policies and practices. © American SociologicalAssociation 2011.},

Building on Conservation of Resources theory, we expect that cross-domain communication has positive effects on role-based resource loss and gain as well as both work–family conflict and enrichment. Furthermore, we suggest that the relationships between cross-domain communication and role-based resource loss and gain vary across different levels of role response expectations and role relationship quality. We test our ideas with data from two studies. Results confirm the role of cross-domain communication on work–family conflict and enrichment through role-based resource loss and gain. We also find significant interactions involving cross-domain communication, role response expectations, and role relationship quality on both work- and family-based resource loss and gain as well as on the mediating effects of family-based resource loss. Practitioner points: Cross-domain work and family communication is not always harmful to employees’ work and family interface. When employees engaged in cross-domain communication perceive high work (family) response expectations and high-quality work (family) relationships, they experience more personal resource losses and gains within the family (work) domain. Managers need to educate employees regarding both the pros and cons of cross-domain work and family communication and provide them with explicit rules about how they can navigate the double-edged functions of communicating across work and family domains. Training employees to manage communications across domains will enable them to reduce potential work–family conflict and enhance work–family enrichment. © 2019 The British Psychological Society},

In the course of this transformation, school leadership and management have become exceptionally complex and increasingly demanding with the leadership team being accountable for business management as well as pedagogical leadership. This article explores through loosely structured thematic interviews with headteachers and school business managers whether there is a demand for voluntary business management support from businesses.

In a series of recent cases, gay rights advocates have persuaded courts to expand the concept of immutability to include not just those traits an individual cannot change, but also those considered too important for anyone to be asked to change. Sexual orientation and religion are paradigmatic examples. This Article critically examines this new concept of immutability, asking whether it is fundamentally different from the old one and how it might apply to characteristics on the borders of employment discrimination law’s protection, such as obesity, pregnancy, and criminal records. It argues that the new immutability does not avoid the old version’s troublesome judgments about which traits are morally blameworthy and introduces new difficulties by requiring problematic judgments about which traits are important. Ultimately, immutability considerations of both the old and new varieties distract from the aim of employment discrimination law: targeting unreasonable and systemic forms of bias. © 2015, Yale Law Journal.

Latent growth modelling of a pseudo-panel data set derived from the European Working Conditions Survey reveals that significantly different rates of change have led to an increasing polarization of job discretion between occupations and between Nordic and other European countries. Across occupations the findings are in keeping with routine-biased technical change rather than skill-biased technical change theories and suggest that the effects of technical change on job discretion depend largely on whether technology substitutes or complements job tasks. Across countries, the results are in line with employment regime theory, which suggests that institutional differences (particularly employment policies and trade union influence) are driving cross-national variation in job discretion. Overall, a more comprehensive empirical and theoretical understanding is provided of factors shaping change in a key aspect of job quality, namely job discretion. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies},

This paper explores the effects on job demands and resources to understand the processes through which telework impacts the exhaustion and engagement of the teleworker. We find that the positive effect of telework revolves around reduced work pressure and role conflict and increased autonomy. The negative effect of telework is expressed through increased role ambiguity and reduced support and feedback.

Employing the 'Job Demands-Resources model', the study considered particularly substantial telework a job resource, and looked into the direct and indirect relationships between 'substantial telework' and the two outcome variables. Employing multivariate regression analyses, empirical support was found for the proposition that substantial telework is associated with more flow. Remarkably, this was particularly felt when employees were interrupted more frequently in their home offices. Moreover, particularly teleworkers who reported frequent overtime and more job autonomy expressed lower exhaustion levels when they teleworked substantially than when they teleworked marginally. Whether these outcomes also hold for other worker categories, such as lower educated employees, requires further investigation.},

Findings indicated that the impact of ICT self-discipline varies depending on the organisation and industry an employee works in. Insights and recommendations for future research are shared in this paper. Findings from this study contribute to IS research and practice. © 2015 authors.},

Design/methodology/approach – Four types of workplace teams are analyzed using linked employer and employee data from the British Workplace Employee Relations Survey. Findings – Workplace teams are positively associated with wages but negatively associated with wage dispersion within establishments. The four team variables examined have the same directional influence on both wages and dispersion suggesting that it is the use of teams that is important not necessarily the particular characteristics of teams that are being used. The role of occupation is also examined as teams may be more likely to form in certain occupations. The team results for both wages and wage dispersion are robust to the inclusion of detailed occupational information. Originality/value – The influence of workplace teams is examined on both employee wages and wage dispersion within establishments. Additionally, the paper extends the previous empirical literature on teams by controlling for occupations at a fine level of detail not previously explored. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {There is an abundance of research saying that not only is leadership in higher education ineffective but also that it actually undermines the essential work that should be happening in universities. Christopher M. Branson, Maureen Marra, Margaret Franken and Dawn Penney provide a new insight into leadership that has proven to be far more effective for all involved - the transrelational approach to leadership. This new way of leading places an emphasis on the importance of the relationships that the leader develops with each and every person they are leading. However, in order to apply this new way of leading, higher education institutions must change some of the key ways they work. This book provides direction in how this can happen, what benefits would result, and offers a view on what the future for higher education might be if such changes to leadership are not made. Leadership in Higher Education from a Transrelational Perspective both critiques the likely implications of adopting this transrelational form of leadership into a higher educational institution and discusses the implications of not doing so. Although a transrelational approach to leadership might seem daunting for higher education institutions to adopt, is there any other choice? The authors argue that it is inconceivable for institutions founded upon promoting human development as a consequence of research to ignore such research that not only questions the suitability of current leadership practices but also offers a more effective alternative. © Christopher M.

Although there is a vast amount of literature indicating the positive association between job autonomy and work-related outcomes, there has been little discussion about the contextual conditions that strengthen this relationship. This paper analyzes the role of perceived organizational alignment as a conditional factor and shows that autonomy alone cannot explain an organization's success in improving work-related outcomes. An analysis of online survey from 481 employees shows that the perceived organizational alignment moderates the positive effect of autonomy on work-related outcomes in the context of flexible work. For employees who perceive organizational alignment to be high, the positive relationships are strengthened for work engagement and organizational identification, but attenuated for job satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019, mrev.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to establish to what extent family-friendly practices and high-performance work practices are positively related to work–family balance and to identify the role played by job satisfaction and working hours as mediators of this relationship Design/methodology/approach: We use data for a representative sample of almost 17,000 employees of dual-earner couples from European countries. To test the mediation mechanism implied by our hypotheses, we follow the procedure outlined in Baron and Kenny (1986). Given the nature of the dependent variables, ordered probit and regression models were estimated in the analysis. Findings: The results show that, in general, family-friendly practices and high-performance work practices increase work–family balance and that these positive relationships are partially mediated by job satisfaction and working hours. While both family-friendly practices and high-performance work practices increase job satisfaction, only the first increase working hours. Moreover, job satisfaction increases work–family balance, while working hours reduces it. The net effect of these opposing forces on work–family balance is positive. Research limitations/implications: The use of secondary data posits some constraints, such as the type of measures and the failure to control for a higher number of family-friendly practices and high-performance work practices. Additionally, the non-longitudinal nature of the data set implies that some relationships cannot be considered causal in the intended direction. Practical implications: Managers should implement family-friendly practices and high-performance work practices, as, in general, they increase work–family balance. A significant portion of this positive effect is channeled through job satisfaction and working hours. Originality/value: The paper contributes to understanding the relationship between different subsets of human-resources management practices and work–family balance, proposing a model that aims to disentangle the mediating mechanisms through which this relationship occurs. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

For some firms, work–life programs are having their intended effect: absenteeism declines, loyalty and retention increase, the ability to recruit talented employees improves, and many employees report that their productivity improves. However, for other firms, work–life programs are not successful, or do not reach their potential for enhancing work–life balance for employees. In some cases employees may not be aware the programs exist, in other cases employees are fearful that their careers will suffer if they participate in the programs. Further, programs sometimes fail because they are not implemented properly, as when employees are not given the necessary technical and management support to work from home. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss potential barriers that may impede the successful implementation and utilization of work–life programs. I will begin by discussing the underlying assumptions and values that influence the way employees and employers think about work and family. For example, I will discuss the ways in which organizations and individuals define success, and how these traditional definitions limit their ability to think creatively about new ways of working. © Cambridge University Press 2008.},

	abstract = {Background Physician call schedules are a critical element for medical practice and hospital efficiency. We compared readmission rates prior to and after a change in physician call system at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Methods We studied patients discharged over a decade (2004 through 2013) and identified whether or not each patient was readmitted within the subsequent 28 days. We excluded patients discharged for a surgical, obstetrical, or psychiatric diagnosis. We used time-to-event analysis and time-series analysis to compare rates of readmission prior to and after the physician call system change (January 1, 2009). Results A total of 89,697 patients were discharged, of whom 10,001 (11%) were subsequently readmitted and 4280 died. The risk of readmission was increased by about 26% following physician call system change (9.7% vs 12.2%, P <.001). Time-series analysis confirmed a 26% increase in the readmission rate after call system change (95% confidence interval, 22%-31%; P <.001). The increase in readmission rate after call system change persisted across patients with diverse ages, estimated readmission risks, and medical diagnoses. The net effect was equal to 7240 additional patient days in the hospital following call system change. A modest increase was observed at a nearby acute care hospital that did not change physician call system, and no increase in risk of death was observed with increased hospital readmissions. Conclusion We suggest that changes in physician call systems sometimes increase subsequent hospital readmission rates. Further reductions in readmissions may instead require additional resources or ingenuity. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential for workplace partnership to produce mutual gains through the implementation of high-performance, flexible-working initiatives. Using a large manager-employee matched dataset, originating in the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS 2004), it focuses upon a range of related workplace practices reported by manager and employees as available or in use in their establishment, to consider the extent to which their implementation is associated with mutual benefits (positive-sum), reported by both managers and employee respondents, or whether gains for one group occur at potential cost to another (zero-sum). Bivariate probit models allow measures of manager and employee-reported organisational outcomes to endogenously affect each other, first from a managerial perspective, second from an employee perspective and third from a combined managerial and employee perspective. The results highlight the significant potential for partnership agreements to deliver mutual gains, albeit within a narrower range of workplace practices than might be the case if the innovation package was designed with the primary interest of only one group in mind. Unsurprisingly, managers and employees were found to have different perspectives in relation to partnership arrangements, with the latter having the more realistic expectations of achievable outcomes. However, since partnership agreements, as defined by this paper, remain underdeveloped within UK workplaces, with only 8% of the sampled 23,000 employees benefiting from such workplace arrangements, the evidence advanced by this paper would indicate a potential scope for realisable gains deriving from well-designed, participatory forms of partnership. © 2014 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The reconciliation of unpaid care and paid work is arguably the most pressing and difficult problem currently facing employment law. In all of its forms, unpaid care is predominantly provided by women so that its intersection with paid work is severely gendered. In recent years, European integration has focused on increasing employment rates whilst maintaining labour market flexibility. Many workers who seek to combine unpaid care with paid employment find themselves engaged in increasingly precarious forms of work, yet legal and policy responses have, to date, been reactive and incremental resulting in a framework which is operationally ineffective in certain respects. This book aims to explore the potential for the development of a specific right to care within European employment law which would facilitate the reconciliation of these two central aspects of an individual's life and assist in the rebalancing of paid and unpaid work between men and women. The central premise is that the current constitutional and regulatory framework is sufficiently flexible to take account of the diverse circumstances and resulting needs of working carers and that the European Court of Justice has the competence and capability to provide the necessary creativity to give effect to such a right. What is needed to instil coherence and consistency is a specific focus on the caring rights of employees. © N. Busby, 2011. All rights reserved.},

Our ongoing research program on digital nomadism informs a Hegelian dialectical analysis and an envisioning of the future(s) of knowledge work. We contrast the Factory paradigm of work (thesis), exemplified by the “ideal type” of the 9-to-5 corporate worker, with the Hypermobility paradigm of work (antithesis), exemplified by the ideal type of the digital nomad. Reflecting on this contrast, we envision the possible digital futures of knowledge work as a continuous spectrum, ranging from a future based on the Digital Taylorism paradigm of work to a future based on the Worker Autonomy paradigm of work. These futures are discussed in terms of different approaches to organizing work, working with technology, delineating work/life boundaries, and provisioning the social safety net. IS researchers are uniquely positioned to perform research and inform decision-making in all these areas, and thus make a difference in determining whether the future we end up with more closely resembles Digital Taylorism or the Worker Autonomy vision. © 2020 by the Association for Information Systems.},

	abstract = {4. Family influences on the career life cycle T. Alexandra Beauregard In an era when 49 per cent of UK workers report that balancing work and family responsibilities is an issue of significant concern to them (JP Morgan Fleming, 2003), the influence of family and personal life on career decisions is receiving increasing amounts of media attention. Today’s business school graduates are ‘looking for a workstyle to go with their lifestyle’, claims the HR consultancy Hay Group (The Economist, 2006). ‘Generation X and Generation Y workers, who are younger than 40, are more likely than boomers to say they put family before jobs’, says an article in USA Today (Elias, 2004). ‘Today’s younger employees are working to live rather than living to work’, states a newspaper manager in the journalism newsletter Fusion (Williamson, 2006). These media sound bites are supported by ongoing research conducted by Schein (1978, 1993, 1996) on the construct of career anchors. An individual’s career anchor can be described as his or her self-concept, incorporating perceived career-related abilities and talents, values, and motivations and needs (Schein, 1996). The five original career anchors consisted of technical/functional competence, managerial competence, security and stability, creativity, and autonomy and independence. More recently, however, the ‘lifestyle’ anchor has emerged as an offshoot of the ‘security and stability’ anchor, and is concerned not with economic stability like its predecessor, but with the stability of one’s general life pattern. An employee identifying lifestyle as his or her career anchor values…. © Mustafa F. Özbilgin and Ayala Malach-Pines 2007.},

Among female respondents, an increase in the importance ascribed to “professional autonomy” was associated with decreased likelihood of being employed in a management role in corporate Canada.

This study aims to demonstrate how and under which organizational circumstances job autonomy can increase work–life balance satisfaction of humanitarian aid expatriates. We hypothesize that especially in humanitarian work, trust in management can buffer potential negative effects of high autonomy. We test our hypothesis by means of ordinal logistic regression, using survey data collected among expatriates of the Operational Center Amsterdam of Médecins Sans Frontières (N = 142). Results reveal that high levels of autonomy are positively related with work–life balance satisfaction when trust in the management of the organization is high. When trust in management is low, the effect of high autonomy on work–life balance satisfaction is negative. This implies that trust in management indeed buffers negative effects of high autonomy among expatriate humanitarian aid workers. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

	abstract = {Flexibility is a key issue in organizational life, especially because organizations rely on work from remote locations and create policies to accommodate worklife balance. Most existing research examines workplace fexibility in primarily the individual or the organizational domain. Views of communication in these domains typically embrace transmission or transaction assumptions without concern for how organizational discourses shape the enactment of fexibility. This paper argues that workplace fexibility emerges from the intersection among the discourses linked to four domains: organizational policies and arrangements; workplace norms and practices; workersupervisor relationships; and an individual's sense of agency. We contend that the discourses rooted in and across these domains introduce contradictions that come from an organizational logic that perpetuates a competition between work and life. In this logic, the burden of workplace flexibility is placed on individual workers who must make choices about whether to ignore or rebuke normative organizational practices. Rather than placing the onus on individuals, we argue that organizations need to adopt a new philosophy grounded in a discourse of adaptability, one that both workers and employers embrace. The discourse of adaptability supersedes workplace flexibility and transforms workers' needs and the organization's objectives into a system of worker autonomy that incorporates fuidity in achieving both personal and organizational goals. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

This article presents fully observed recursive structural equation estimates, based on data from the authors’ original repeated survey of Estonian creative R&D employees on a sample of 153 individuals from eleven entities. It finds that opting for flexible working time is strongly driven by gender—males are more likely than females to opt for R&D jobs with flexible schedules. R&D employees who mainly work remotely are more satisfied with their work results. Noncreative work tasks reduce R&D employees’ contentment with their work outcomes and lower—at least in their own perception—the productiveness of their work in terms of creating value or new knowledge. Employees of both evening and morning types are found to have much more satisfaction with their work results than employees with no distinct morning-evening profile. These findings stress the benefits of flexible work arrangements in creative R&D jobs in order to account for individual differences and stimulate R&D output.

	abstract = {People’s work orientations and attitudes to paid work are highly important for the welfare of any country. Still, little is currently known about how such attitudes are distributed among different countries, men and women, classes, occupations, age groups and so on. Even less is known about how work orientations have changed during the dramatic social transformations of economies and labour markets during recent decades. What happened, for example, to work orientations in Iceland when the country went bankrupt? The answer is quite surprising. Or, is it true that work is losing its position in people’s lives in Western world? What is the relationship between people’s attitudes to work and the way they actually behave on the labour market? This timely book deals with these questions - and more - presenting fresh knowledge on changes in work orientations in many countries. It is based on genuine theoretical arguments and thorough empirical studies, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. It is a great source of new knowledge on work orientations and changes in attitudes to work. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Time-use refers to the amount of time spent working and how that time is allocated over a particular period. A growing number of scholars are considering how social context—people’s immediate social environments (e.g., colleagues and managers, norms, work groups, and nonwork demands)—shape time-use. However, this research is fragmented across disciplines, methods, and levels of analysis. To integrate and ad-vance knowledge in this area, we review empirical studies that inform current understanding of social context and time-use. In doing so, we develop a framework that reveals how the extant literature coalesces around four taken-for-granted social meanings: time-use as dedication, time-use as performance, time-use as identity, and time-use as power. These four meanings are anchored in broadly shared societal ideologies but are enacted and interpreted locally as people engage time in a specific context. Looking across the four social meanings, we discuss how they are inter-connected, and identify overarching themes that unite them. Building on these insights, we suggest important directions for future research on the social context of time-use. © Academy of Management Annals.},

	abstract = {The Spanish labor law considers as one of the legal mechanisms of conciliation of personal and professional life the possibility of suspending the employment relationship in certain cases for a shorter or shorter period of time, among which is the leave of absence for the care of a child or a relative, provided for in article 46.3 of the Workers' Statute (ET). It is easily imaginable that workers throughout their working life have a concrete need to reconcile work and family / personal life by circumstances that are expected to be maintained over time; necessity that tries to be solved through the suspensive mechanism of the leave. Our system contemplates this possibility not in a generic way, which could allow alleging any family or personal circumstance, but it specifies the recourse to leave to two causes, the care of a child and the care of a family member, who, from the level of labor law, give rise to two protected cases whose configuration differs precisely in the case of fact and not so much in the legal regime that is tied to it, except in regard to the unjustified differentiation in the configuration of the duration of each of them and the expected effects on social protection. Regarding the leave as a conciliation mechanism, we will try to reflect on this study, not so much by exposing the totality of its legal regime but by exposing some critical points that require a reform or an express and clear pronouncement of the legislator. There are in their current legal configuration a series of forecasts that either pose interpretative problems or their presence is questionable, while there are silences about aspects that should be clarifíed in a future reform. In any case, it must be borne in mind that the ultimate purpose pursued with leave of absence for family reasons is the reconciliation of work and family life. And I say this because any interpretation that is made must bear this ratio in mind, while we must know that it is a leave tied to two specific assumptions. These two preventions should guide the adoption of any interpretative solution, as the Constitutional Court has clearly stated in stating that «the constitutional dimensión of the normative measures aimed at facilitating the reconciliation of working and family life of working people, both from the perspective of the right to non-discrimination due to personal circumstances (Article 14 CE), as from the perspective of the mándate to protect the family and children (Article 39 EC), it must prevail and serve as guidance for the solution of any interpretative doubt». This study begins by addressing its legislative development from its first formulation in our order to its current configuration that will foreseeably be subject to a new legislative amendment when the new Directive on parental leave is approved. In the exposition of its historical evolution, the turning point that the nature of the leave for family reasons underwent, from its configuration as voluntary leave to its assimilation to an assumption of forced exceedance. Next, its configuration is treated as a causal and unconditioned right, while addressing the role that collective autonomy can play in the regulation of this type of leave. In the first place, it is affirmed that we are facing a causal right because it must be recognized when one of the two causes reflected in the statutory provisión (either the care of a child, natural or adopted or of a minor in a situation of legal guardianship) occurs. or the care of a family member), which means that this leave may be denied if the cause of the authorization is not assessed. In the second place, we are facing an unconditional right because the cause proven by the employer can not oppose any reason to deny or defer the enjoyment of this type of leave. In the third place, the space that collective bargaining can play in the configuration of this leave opens up the debate of how far that can go, maintaining that it will be able to introduce improvements as long as they do not condition either the granting or the exercise of the leave. The next aspect that is addressed are the problems posed by the configuration of the subjects that enable the application and enjoyment of the leave of absence. In relation to the care of children, the need to recognize it in cases of temporary or urgent care, the establishment of a máximum age of the adopted or sheltered child, from which it would not be possible to apply for it and, finally, the need to address it, is addressed. to clarify to whom if the separation or divorce has any incidence in the recognition of this right. Regarding the care of a family member, the need to bet on an extensive concept of the family and the convenience of clarifying whether to go on this leave for the care of a child over three years is addressed. The leave of absence for the care of a relative, unlike the care of children, is subject to verification of one or more of the budgets that are Usted (age, illness, accident or disability) as well as the condition that the family member does not develop paid activity. Both aspects are subject of analysis to conclude that budgets should be changed by the requirement of accreditation of a situation of helplessness; while the requirement of not performing remunerated activity should be replaced by the establishment of a limit of economic resources above which the benefit of this leave could not be requested. The duration of the leave has raised, on the one hand, an intense debate in the doctrine betting some for the need to reduce it, as it involves a solution that eliminates the possible flaw of discrimination while promoting co-responsibility, and others advocating its maintenance, to fulfill other purposes besides the conciliators. On the other hand, the lack of justification of the different duration foreseen for each of the enabling causes of this leave, the problems posed by the possibility of its conventional expansión in the case of caring for a family member, the lack of coordination between the maternity leave and the leave of absence for the care of children, and, fínally, the problems that can be generated by the legal recognition of the fractionation of their enjoyment. The possible compatibility of the enjoyment of leave for family reasons and the performance of a job, as well as the possible succession of leave are two issues that do not have a clear answer in the light of legal forecast and that are subject of study to conclude that they should be the object of legislative attention in a future reform to, respectively, admit compatibility as long as the new work supposes an improvement from the conciliation bonus and to clarify, on the one hand, what right the worker has -reserve from the same position or reservation of a post- when there is a succession of leave, and, on the other hand, clarify in what cases the same subject can give the right to a succession of leave for family reasons. Finally, the guarantees that are tied to the enjoyment of this leave are addressed. The configuration of the right of reservation of the job is analyzed, denouncing that its differentiation according to its duration is more apparent than real, while highlighting the need for a legal provisión regarding the establishment of a period of time to announce the reincorporation to the company. In terms of training, a greater role of the worker is postulated when it comes to being able to determine their training needs when they return to work. And in the calculation of the calculation of seniority, it is postulated the need to clarify whether said period is computed for the purpose of calculating compensation for termination of the contract. © 2017 Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social.

Government scientists have applied research objectives but must still meet the profession’s requirements for legitimisation through independent research and peer-reviewed publishing to be recognised professionally as ‘scientists’. This study examines the impact of organisational change and downsizing in an Australian government science agency on the professional status security of its scientists. It uses a mixed method approach involving one focus group, 22 in-depth interviews and 803 survey responses. It finds that structural change reduced scientists’ professional status security and that a context of job insecurity and limited external employment opportunities inhibits individual scientists’ capacity to resist adverse changes to their work conditions. © The Author(s) 2018.},

Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to identify whether firms adopt different SW models, explore complementarities between the factors that can lead to choose a SW model, and figure out whether contingent variables matters in the implementation of a particular SW model. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on: a survey delivered in 2013 to 100 Human Resources directors of medium and large Italian organizations to collect preliminary evidence on SW; and four embedded case studies based on 49 semi-structured interviews to better explain the findings achieved in the quantitative analysis. Findings: Four SW models can be chosen by companies. They are named inconsistent, analogical, digital and complete SW. They are different according to investments in the enabling digital technologies, in trans-formations of the organizational policies and in workspace settings, according the contingent conditions where firms operate. Results show that there are complementarities between the elements that characterize a SW model and that at least two elements are developed in each SW model. In case all the three elements are developed, companies achieve higher labour productivity. Originality/value: The paper unpacks the elements that can generate SW environments by deepening the complementarities that can be exploited among information and communication technologies, work place and work practice innovation, and by evaluating their development on employees’ performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Despite their contributions, research findings reveal tensions and contradictions in the ways that employees, managers and organizations develop, enact and respond to these flexibility initiatives. This critical review identifies three primary tensions (variable vs fixed arrangements, supportive vs unsupportive work climates and equitable vs inequitable implementation of policies) that reveal inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings. We tie these tensions, and the management of them, to an overarching dilemma in implementing workplace flexibility, the autonomy-control paradox. To develop alternatives for handling these tensions, we recommend reframing them through changing organizational cultures, adopting a philosophy of adaptability, customizing work and making workplace flexibility an employee right. We conclude by urging organizations and society to reframe the tensions between work and life, to treat them as enriching rather than competing with each other and to transcend these opposite poles through exploring third spaces. © The Author(s) 2013.},

Fixed-effects analyses indicated that the well-being of individuals who switched to the employer-oriented flexible time arrangement followed a chronic strain pattern (women) or adaptation pattern (men). The effect of the transition to an employee-oriented flexible time arrangement is not unanimous: women appear to profit from this arrangement in the long run in terms of increased satisfaction with leisure time, whereas men experience deterioration in satisfaction with leisure time, followed by adaptation. At best, the effect of this transition on job satisfaction is short-lived for both genders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

In recent years a growing number of employers in the UK has introduced flexible working options for employees in response to increasing concerns over work - life balance and the desire to be seen as an 'employer of choice'. At the same time there has been considerable policy debate among European Union (EU) members over job quality and the need to create not only more but better jobs. It might be expected that since flexible working affords a degree of choice to employees, it would impact positively on their perceptions of job quality. However, to date few studies have explicitly examined how flexible working can contribute to job quality. Where studies have examined outcomes relevant to aspects of job quality, the evidence is somewhat inconclusive. The research reported in this article was designed to explore how experiences of flexible working have influenced employees' perceptions of a range of job quality dimensions. The findings show a generally strong, positive relationship between flexible working and perceptions of job quality, but also that there are perceived costs to job quality, particularly in relation to longer term opportunities for development and progression, suggesting that the relationship is more complex.},

Drawing on a range of theories, this article also examines potential indirect effects on employee performance via job satisfaction and organizational commitment and analyzes whether these relationships vary according to whether the arrangement was set up through a formal process or negotiated informally between the employee and his or her line manager. Extant research has tended to focus on formal arrangements, however, informal arrangements are widespread and may better accommodate work-life preferences, thereby potentially fostering more positive attitudes from employees. Survey data from 2,617 employees in four large organizations with well-established flexible working policies are analyzed. Results from structural equation models show average positive indirect effects from informal flexible working, but also negative direct effects from formal flexible working. When two forms of flexible working amenable to being set up by both formal and informal means are examined separately, formal arrangements for flexibility over working hours are found to be negatively associated with performance, but also a source of greater job satisfaction; informal remote working arrangements have positive indirect effects via organizational commitment and job satisfaction on worker performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

It provides the student with real-life examples from managers (based on interviews with people who experienced discrimination) that help students understand how gender discrimination operates, even when there are legal protections against it. At the end of each case study, students are asked to put themselves in the shoes of the individual experiencing the discrimination and ask themselves reflect on how they would handle the situation. Students must examine their own beliefs about gender and work place practices and consider consequences of actions they might take. In addition to the sections of theory, cases, and legal challenges, websites of interest are included student assignments and classroom activities. Key features include: Engaging case studies embedded in each chapter. Legal cases that highlight each chapter and lend credibility to each case study. Discussions of international/global situations.

	abstract = {This book is a longitudinal life history of the lives and work of primary school principals in Ireland. It provides a unique opportunity to peer inside the realities of leading schools in changing times. In a system that until recently did not prepare principals for the onerous roles and responsibilities, a small system with limited mobility, inter-personal relationships emerge as critical, frequently privileged over professional relationships. Consequently, principals struggle to bring about change, to build trust in order to cultivate a transformative leadership agenda, while several aspects of systemic structures and processes emerge as constraints on leadership capacity building. In the absence of comprehensive leadership portfolio development, classroom teachers, catapulted into the principal's office, tend to be cautious and careful in ways that tend to perpetuate the status quo while putting a premium on the exercise of soft power and an over-reliance on the good will of colleagues. Several of the 'leadership lessons' that emerge from this in-depth analysis concur with an increasing international consensus that due to complexity and increasingly performative policy demands, learning about leadership for all is an absolute necessity. However, care must be taken to avoid overly scripted programmes. Critical to the cultivation of a professionally responsible leadership disposition, rather than capitulation to 'technologies of control,' is professional renewal cultivated through adequate attention to the Zone of Proximal Distance. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 50 principals, all from the elementary and secondary educational systems of Israel. The analysis followed the principles of qualitative research. Findings: Four subjectively held constructs of principal workload, main sources of this workload, and the key strategies used by principals to face this workload were found in this study. Practical implications: It is recommended to strengthen school autonomy, increase the number of positions of middle management, prepare future principals for the heavy workload, and encourage supportive superiors who are sensitive to this issue. Originality/value: This study fills the gap in theoretical knowledge concerning principal workload, assuming that the particular characteristics of the school organization have some unique impact on this personal state. It also enables us to identify the types of this personal state occurring in educational organizations from the subjective perspectives of school members and stakeholders, thereby broadening the understanding of employee workload in various settings, including educational arenas. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

First, to provide context, we offer an overview of the literature on the organization and control of managerial work, tracing contributions mainly from the early 1950s onwards. Second, we discuss the first of two related concerns relevant to understanding the contemporary nature of managerial work – strategies of organizational restructuring: an analysis highlighting the role of downsizing and delayering within corporate campaigns promoting ‘post-bureaucratic’ systems. Third, we extend this discussion by addressing how such corporate restructuring affects managers in their everyday work – notably in relation to the perceptions and realities of growing job insecurity and career uncertainty: an analysis that frequently draws upon our own investigations to establish an agenda for future research. The article concludes by summarizing the content of four research articles whose arguments relate to issues discussed in this analysis of managerial work. © The Author(s) 2019.},

Findings: Intrinsic work values are associated with greater subjective well-being, whereas extrinsic work values are associated with lower subjective well-being. Consistent with the buffer hypothesis, intrinsic work value orientation reduces the negative effect of working hours on worker’s well-being, and extrinsic orientation enhances the negative effect. Originality/value: This paper calls into question the importance of working conditions relative to worker values when assessing the role that job demands and resources play in the new economy.

	abstract = {Sexual harassment law and family leave policy originated as feminist reform projects designed to protect women in the workplace. But many academics now ask whether harassment and leave policies have outgrown their gendered roots. The anti-bullying movement advocates taking the "sexual" out of harassment law to prohibit all forms of on-the-job mistreatment. Likewise, the work-life balance movement advocates taking the "family" out of leave policy to require employers to accommodate all types of life pursuits. These proposals are in line with recent cases and scholarship on civil rights that reframe problems once seen as issues of inequality as deprivations of liberty or dignity. I refer to this trend as the universal turn in workplace protections. This Article urges caution with respect to the universal turn. Drawing on feminist legal and political theory, it provides a set of questions to ask in evaluating proposals to universalize protections. It concludes that anti-bullying and work-life proposals are likely to dilute feminist workplace gains and mask inequality. If the universal rule swallows the antidiscrimination rule, the transformative potential of requiring employers and the public to scrutinize the workplace for gender discrimination is lost. Sexual harassment is seen as no worse than personality conflicts, and recreational pursuits are supported to the same extent as caretaking responsibilities. The benefits of sexual harassment law and leave policy are likely to be diluted. I therefore oppose universal approaches to harassment and work-life conflicts that would simply expand civil rights protections to cover harms other than discrimination. Instead of the universal turn, this Article proposes a hybrid approach focused on inclusivity that would expand protections incrementally without abandoning equality.},

The grim reality of a society in which some are overworked, whilst others are condemned to intermittent work and unemployment, is progressively more difficult to tolerate. In this thought-provoking book, David Frayne questions the central place of work in mainstream political visions of the future, laying bare the ways in which economic demands colonise our lives and priorities. Drawing on his original research into the lives of people who are actively resisting nine-to-five employment, Frayne asks what motivates these people to disconnect from work, whether or not their resistance is futile, and whether they might have the capacity to inspire an alternative form of development, based on a reduction and social redistribution of work. A crucial dissection of the work-centred nature of modern society and emerging resistance to it, The Refusal of Work is a bold call for a more humane and sustainable vision of social progress. © David Frayne 2015.},
