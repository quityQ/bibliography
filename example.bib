Consumers are constantly hailed by games platforms through freemium business models that offer cosmetic items contained in loot boxes or recurring subscriptions. Thus far, game studies and consumer studies have been unable to account for the totality of how these new and dynamic platforms circumvent legal barriers and attract potential consumers. This paper argues that a hybrid research model combining platform studies, socio-cultural critique of gamblification, and political economy is required in order to theorize and explicate how these platforms operate. The platformized and gamblified model for game distribution seeks to regulate and configure networks of association between consumers and producers with the ultimate aim of eliciting participation on platforms.},

We find that Xbox had a small quality advantage over the incumbent, PlayStation 2, and the strength of indirect network effects and the consumers' discount factor, while statistically significant, fall in the region where PlayStation 2's position is unsustainable.

	abstract = {Many platform strategies focus on indirect network effects between sellers through platform expansion. In this paper, we show sellers on the console video game platform generate a positive intertemporal spillover effect and expand the demand for other sellers, holding the set of platform adopters fixed. We propose a novel identification strategy that leverages exogenous variation in the release timing of games exclusively available on a console platform, and examine how this variation affects the sales of games available on both platforms. We find a sizable intertemporal demand spillover effect between games: A 1\% increase in total copies sold on a platform leads to a 0.153\% increase in the sales of other games in the next month (i.e., an elasticity of 0.153). Additional analysis suggests this demand spillover effect is reminiscent of habit formation on the consumer side, in that past purchases keep end users active on the platform. Our finding provides a potential explanation for recent platform sales events and subscription services that provide free games to consumers every month.

The results from this case highlight the importance of users’ active role in the evolution.

This article analyses the disruptive potential of Valve’s game distribution platform, Steam, focusing specifically on how Steam has evolved into a de facto online social network and how Valve uses constant feature changes as part of its corporate rhetoric. Despite its profound influence on the video game industry, scholarly inquiry into Steam has focused on analyses of user or value creation. However, Steam arguably derives its long-term disruptive potential from combining the gamification of digital distribution with the formation of ephemeral public spheres around the games that it distributes, thereby becoming a de facto online social network. To investigate this strategy, the article employs a historically comparative affordance analysis, drawing on a small data set of Steam blog posts and tech blog coverage from 2007 to 2018 to map patterns of affordance change.},

Zuerst möchte ich einen kurzen Überblick über die Geschichte der Computer- und Videospiele geben, da sich aus den vergangenen Entwicklungen sowohl die heutigen Trends als auch die Versäumnisse ableiten lassen, die die Industrie in der aktuellen Marktentwicklung zu beheben wünscht. Als Beispiel könnte man den Archetypus des spielenden männlichen Teenagers nennen, der lange Zeit das öffentliche Bild prägte, ein Bild, das durch die Ausweitung auf neue Zielgruppen nun im Wandel begriffen ist. Anschließend geht es um die aktuellen Produkte auf dem Unterhaltungssoftwaremarkt, die Plattformen und Spiele.

We do this on the basis of a comparative analysis of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Fortnite: Battle Royale as well as the two platforms on which these games exist. First, we discuss the notion of platform economies in relation to the two cases in question and how this positions the consumer as “prosumer” and “micro-entrepreneur.” Second, we introduce our analytical framework related to game economies and skins as commodities and currencies. On the basis of this, we compare the ways skins are acquired in the two games and the degree to which they extend exist beyond the game. We argue that Epic retains a “skin-monopoly,” within the game, whereas Steam features a free “skin market” that transgresses the platform and turns the “prosumer” into a “micro-entrepreneur” and the “modder” into a “speculator.”},

	abstract = {In the next four chapters, I will provide an empirically grounded analysis of the Steam platform as a particular type of game platform. I will do this because the Steam platform exhibits a distinct platform business model rooted in the economic features of games. Steam is, on one hand, comparable to other market platforms, with its focus on attracting game publishers and gamer communities into a multi-sided market controlled by the platform owner. On the other hand, it differs from other platforms in its active integration of player-driven economies at different levels of its platform design. This turns Steam into a direct illustration of the way platforms can be defined and analysed as ‘tangled markets’, extracting value at the intersection between different market contexts. In the following sections, I will firstly provide some historical context of Valve, the owner of Steam, and situate the Steam platform within the wider game market. After this, I will address how the platform differs from other platforms and why this makes it an interesting case of ‘tangled markets’. I will use the key differences between Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (Valve, 2012) and Fortnite (2018) to exemplify how this specific business model cuts across the game design, the platform, and economic practices beyond the platform (Thorhauge and Nielsen, 2021).},

I first discuss Steam as a distinct type of platform economy due to its roots in player-driven game economies. I then introduce the notion of ‘markets as fields’ as my analytical framework. Based on this framework, I describe three different contexts of economic transaction: the Steam Game Store, the Steam Community Workshop and the Steam Community Market. I analyse how the approximately 46,500 game titles published on the platform are distributed across these contexts and how these games can be ranked with regard to current player numbers, and discuss Valve’s position as combined platform owner, game developer and game publisher.},

	abstract = {Research Summary Many platforms rely on volunteer contributions for value creation. Thus, unpaid contributors are valuable to the platform, but control over their activities is limited. We study whether and how volunteer communities can provide a competitive advantage and ask how contributor behavior depends on a platform's competitive position. We propose two channels: First, a stronger competitive position facilitates contributor coordination, leading to a larger active community. Second, a platform's competitive position is related to contributor motivation, which drives how much individuals contribute. Studying two competing game wiki platforms, we find that a platform's stronger competitive position is associated with higher activity, primarily driven by the number of contributors, which in turn triggers increased contributions by existing contributors. Further, high-productivity contributors are especially active on a stronger platform. Managerial Summary Online “crowdsourcing” communities create value for many digital platforms, but managing them in a way that ensures productive contributions is challenging. To better understand the conditions under which online communities create value productively we analyze how contribution patterns differ between more and less successful platforms. We study 13 game wiki communities on two competing platforms and find that success is tied to higher activity, which is in turn the result of more manpower in the value creation process, but also higher productivity by individual contributors. In addition, a dedicated core of highly productive community members is an important driver of platform success. These findings have implications for the motivation of community members, and the entry and growth strategies of crowdsourced platforms.},

A monopoly-holding platform hires a manager to attract new members from both sides of the market while considering uncertainty on the adhesion of viewers and online gamers. First, we mathematically demonstrate that increasing cross-group network externalities can decrease the platform’s profit, which contradicts a canonical result from the field of two-sided markets. Moreover, knowing that the intermediary’s goal is aligned with the private interest of online gamers, machine learning models empirically show that the main theoretical outcome is observed in reality due to the presence of heterogeneous indirect network effects in online gaming activities. Second, we conclude that social welfare can be either harmed or improved for increasing cross-group network externalities, which means that the professionalization of online gaming may or may not be legitimized depending on the value taken by exogenous parameters related to the platform’s uncertainty on the number of agents that get on board, risk aversion of viewers, and royalty rate applied to online gamers. Finally, a discussion based on 2020 facts is provided and several policy recommendations are formulated to ensure the persistence of best regulatory practices.},

From the late 1990s, profit-driven gaming companies began to organize and sponsor video game competitions across the country. The past 15 years have seen the commercialization and professionalization of competitive gaming, and the development of the new concept of ‘e-sports’. E-sports draw participants and audiences from China’s rapidly expanding online gaming community. While gaming companies, live-streaming services, and online gaming platforms are making millions of dollars in profits, the booming e-sports culture has facilitated the growth of the online gaming market and contributed to the formation of a vast cohort of online gaming addicts in China. Parents, educationists, and doctors have expressed growing concern over the social and health costs of the e-sports industry. Academia, media, and the general public are becoming more cautious about the development of the e-sports industry, which mostly targets a vulnerable group made up of the country’s children, teens, and young adults.},

A significant fraction of such platforms' revenue is generated by advertisements, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. Thus, it is necessary to understand which factors influence how much time users spend on the platform. We focus on one such factor - the outcome of the previous game. Using data from an online chess platform, we find strong evidence of history-dependent stopping behavior. We identify two primary types of players: those who are more likely to stop playing after a loss and those who are more likely to stop playing after a win. We propose a behavioral dynamic choice model in which the utility from playing another game is directly affected by the previous game's outcome. We structurally estimate this time non-separable preference model and then conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate alternative market designs. In the context of online chess games, a matching algorithm that incorporates stopping behavior can substantially alter the length of play.},

The article is a continuation of the research focused on the popularity, use and impact of games on the behavior of a prominent population and analysis of the typical e-shops with games. Authors has chosen four the most common amongst students computer game services and platforms simultaneously found in the first hundreds of searches in Google to carry on analysis. To support this research authors decided to use CAWI methodology to assess nine groups of features: transparency, site navigation, quality of information, product search quality, advertising, the quality of the order processing, way of visualization and product promotion from the customer’s perspective. Platform analysis was carried out according to: installation package support, application design, search engine quality, transparency, product presentation and security. A qualitative study was conducted to select a sample of selected students using the point method and the point method with preferences to evaluate the distinctive features of the services. A group of over seven hundred randomly selected people from the university was examined. This approach was based on the structure of the article consisting of the presentation of the research hypothesis, the description of the methodology and the research sample, and the analysis of the results and their discussion together with the resulting conclusions.

The main goal of our research presented in this paper is to gather objective, experimental data on this topic. We have executed a user study that exposed users to one simple and one complex game using cloud gaming and PC gaming approaches. After a timed gaming session on both platforms users were asked to fill a questionnaire that aims to reveal their preferences. The results of our study show that for an average casual gamer there is no much difference between cloud gaming and PC gaming. More experienced gamers tend to favor PC gaming, especially on high-end PCs. Both user groups selected cloud gaming as a better solution for low-end hardware. The results of our experiments lead to a conclusion that cloud gaming, in its current form, is not able to replace the PC gaming, but it fills a niche that PC gaming has no possibility of reaching – allowing people to play their favorite titles without having to invest in high-end gaming hardware.},

	doi = {10.5281/zenodo.6788660},
	abstract = {The explosive development of digital media has been creating opportunities for enterprises to change their business strategies and incorporate new-world applications. Businesses use networks for exchanging information from a centralized location as a strategic method of communication. As enterprises move forward with the next-generation network, they can share not only content, but also applications, rich media, and live events. The advancement will affect business functions including e-learning, e-communications, and e-commerce. The CDN is a revolutionary technology that enables enterprises to distribute a new generation of scalable, accelerated, rich Web-based
content, including Television -quality streaming media, for e-business as well as knowledge-sharing solutions. Delivering content locally minimizes the distance between the point where a request is placed and the point where it is served because the content is replicated to the edge of the network. Web sites with higher performance are the result. In
the delivery of content, inherent Internet congestion issues are simply overcome, bandwidth utilization is controlled and optimized, and applications and rich media content are delivered to the desktop. Benefits of content delivery involve central content control, efficient distribution to servers that are at the edge of a network, and automated routing of the content requests that are made to a local edge server. Furthermore, it provides web content developers with a simple way to manage data and accelerates the speed of web access for users. Therefore, content providers can place their content at the closest node from the end-user. As a result, a high-performance and adaptable solution have been developed. Researchers have widely considered content delivery networks to be a powerful solution to lowering these drawbacks. CDNs act as trusted overlay networks that offer high-performance delivery of common Web objects, static data, and rich multimedia content by distributing the load among servers that are close to clients. The benefits of CDNs include reduced origin server load, reduced latency for the end-users, as well as increased throughput. Furthermore, CDNs can improve Web scalability as well as disperse flash-crowd events. In this paper, we provide an overview of CDN development and how it enhances video services, streaming, games, e-commerce, and advertising.

	doi = {10.1109/CIG.2014.6932906},
	abstract = {The collection and analysis of behavioral telemetry in digital games has in the past five years become an integral part of game development. One of the key challenges in game analytics is the development of methods for characterizing and predicting player behavior as it evolves over time. Characterizing behavior is necessary for monitoring player populations and gradually improve game design and the playing experience. Predicting behavior is necessary to describe player engagement and prevent future player churn. In this paper, methods and theory from kernel archetype analysis and random process models are utilized to evaluate the playtime behavior, i.e. time spent playing specific games as a function of time, of over 6 million players, across more than 3000 PC and console games from the Steam platform, covering a combined playtime of more than 5 billion hours. A number of conclusions can be derived from this large-scale analysis, notably that playtime as a function of time, across the thousands of games in the dataset, and irrespective of local differences in the playtime frequency distribution, can be modeled using the same model: the Weibull distribution. This suggests that there are fundamental properties governing player engagement as it evolves over time, which we here refer to as the Playtime Principle. Additionally, the analysis shows that there are distinct clusters, or archetypes, in the playtime frequency distributions of the investigated games. These archetypal groups correspond to specific playtime distributions. Finally, the analysis reveals information about player behavior across a very large dataset, showing for example that the vast majority of games are players for less than 10 hours, and very few players spend more than 30-35 hours on any specific game.},

	abstract = {In the recent years there have been a number of video game streaming platforms emerging
on the market. Cloud gaming services like OnLive and PlayStation Now may ultimately
prove successful in tapping the Internet to deliver instant streaming video games. However, there has been a limited research on these platforms, especially focusing on the end user preferences.

In this thesis, preferences of different gamer groups (hardcore and casual) are studied
in order to identify possible development directions for such services.

A test has been designed and performed with users from the different groups. The
commercial PC-based service OnLive has been used for testing the user experience and
user acceptance of cloud gaming. A custom public game test has been conducted as
well. Observation, user surveys and interviews have been used for data collection.

The experiments done focuses on the users  perception and response towards such
a systems in terms of fidelity, usability, comparison to traditional game delivery and
likelihood of buying into such a model. The thesis takes a holistic approach were not
only the games themselves are tested, but the total experience in using the game service.

At large, the results indicate that casual gamers are more positive to the cloud gaming
service model than hardcore gamers. The findings suggest that one of the reasons are
that casual gamers choose convenience over high fidelity in their game preferences.},

People in the industry are aware of the problem, and the gravity of it has been acknowledged and commented on by many publishers and developers. Yet unlike the Recording Industry Association of America, Motion Picture Association of America, independent movie studios, and other rights holders, computer game developers and publishers have shied away from attempting to sue pirates or otherwise enforce their rights through the legal system. Instead, the industry has looked to a variety of self-help remedies, a fact that has largely not been commented on by legal scholars. This paper examines the successes and pitfalls of these varied non-legal approaches, broadly classifying them into four categories: digital rights management, online-only offerings, making legal easier, and community engagement.},

"Our goal over the next few weeks is continue to make the game more enjoyable as more players are brought in. We hope to make it as smooth as possible for existing players and new players alike," said Valve's Erik Johnson.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify, characterize, and discuss paradigm shifts that have occurred in the video game industry with some emphasis on competition and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – Basically, the paper depends upon a review of the literature associated with video game development. Past history is taken from texts and academic papers dealing with the subject. More current observations are taken from the business and popular press. These observations are placed within a context associated with the classic papers on industry evolution, paradigms, paradigm shifts, competition, and competitiveness. Findings – It is difficult to capture present shifts in such a fast‐growing industry, but these shifts seem clear: the original entry of video games into the arcade sector that led to the industry and the demise of pinball; the development of the home cartridge and console that made the industry a home‐based phenomenon; the entry of independent game‐publishers that made the industry a two‐tiered one; and the development of massively multiplayer online role‐playing games (MMORPGs) that changed the way games are played. Originality/value – The video game industry is an interesting one to follow. To an extent, its development characterizes our generation – fast paced, technologically oriented, and targeted toward the young and young at heart. This paper takes the subject away from a historical or anecdotal approach and places it within the context of industry evolution, paradigms, and paradigm shifts. It thus should be of value to students of not only video games, but also the evolution of rapidly growing industries and establishment of competitive advantages.},
